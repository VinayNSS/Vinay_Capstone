festivals. operation managers take you to restaurants for lunch and dinners after important training or meetings. this happens in every other company. 1. can learn a lot in few teams2. good salary and stocks definitely one of the most data-driven companies in the world and decisions are all made based on solid data support. generally it supports new ideas though it requires a lot lot lot of data to support. and you can learn a lot about the every aspects of the business - supply chain, service provider, a/b test, payment process etc. you name it. it's an environment that you can learn a lot. tons of internal transfer opportunities across functions. your line manager cannot refuse the internal transfer request once you pass the probation period and the new manager accept your request. they can only hold you on your original role for up to 6 weeks. good management; ownership; bias for action great international company with international workers. salaries a pretty good. flexible hours and hr is helpful for lots of things nice working atmospheregood facilitiessalary is also goodyour feedback is takengood hr support gives insight into the scale of operations, how to build products

place and people to be around with work culturehr policy is very tough and supports the employeesopportunity to learn and grow within the organizationopinions can be voiced out and it'll be considered by the top management pay was pretty good and you get plenty of hours 4 day work week was awsome. my perspective is as a pretty senior developer:good compensation - note that glassdoor only shows salary by default while at higher levels at amazon you can get the majority of your pay from stock.if you show ownership you can take on a lot and go far quickly.behaves like a mix of a lot of semi-coordinated startups rather than a single company.it's so giant and does so many things that you can always find something interesting to work on. it's doing really amazing work in a lot of fields and i've got a lot of confidence in the company being successful.the senior technical management is pretty impressive - a lot of the tech vp's are super technical, which is pretty valuable. first: these are my own opinions. i have not been encouraged, in any way, to talk about my amazon experience (as we call it), but i am so grateful to my employer for a steady job and a promising career horizon, that i really want to be sure others see what i know about this company.in aws, i am trusted to do my job, and amazon has worked very hard to put me in a place where i can be the most effective and happy while still having excellent room for growth. i get to work from home when needed, and the health/family benefits are much better than i had expected.the culture here is fantastic,

get fired. production quota seems hard to meet at first, but once you're familiar with the process it gets much easier to make rate. their attendance policy is hands-down the most lenient i've ever seen. because they use an attendance points system, if you manage it right, you can come and go as you please. if you want to leave early or take a day off simply because you feel like it, you can do that without any retribution.benefits: the health insurance is mediocre, but all other benefits are far better. you get free life insurance, free accidental death and dismemberment insurance, free short term/long term disability insurance (which saved my bacon when i was out on medical leave), tuition reimbursement, and $1200 worth of stocks each year.co-workers: i've met a lot of great people during my five years at amazon. you'll have no trouble making new friends.as a business i have a great deal of respect for amazon. i've met jeff bezos. he's a good guy. a few years ago, he visited our facility for a few days and spent a full shift working in a process. that says something about the man who signs our paychecks. very organized work place, clean place to work. they have a process for everything. but they need to have tight control with 1000's of employees working. good compensation, talented people, pretty interesting projects that impact millions of people on a regular basis. you can see your changes have dramatic affects on the companies bottom line. cutting edge tech, world-class engineering, constant innovation, like of like ny: if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere great work environment and employee's its a small division within amazon and has been growing very fast in the past 4-5 years and taking on new challenges, and you get an opportunity to work on them. most of the work here is pure engineering and development as it is a very young group. pays very well, high level of responsibility, with big challenges. i worked too many hours low work load, good pay smart people , lot to learn guaranteed hours, ok pay, overall compensation decent pay, good hours, very supportive management teams, and they are very flexible. they also work great with students. dogs: i love having a work place with dogs when i need to take a breaki also love that the emphasis is on what you get done, rather than time you spent with your butt in the chair you can learn a lot for aws 1) customer obsessed2)work on cutting edge and new products to delight customers3) learn from highly talented and driven employees i get to work with the best and brightest, guide our product development and deliver outstanding experiences for our customers. awesome atmosphere and great people to work with the great benefits and many pto options. the pay rate is great. the jobs were easy and harmless. lots of time off opportunity. no politics. just go to work do your job and your good. fast paced and the comparadarie was excellent! i made my own schedule badhr bad management about there employee great company to work for, always growing, opportunity to set your goals higher. never fails to know that there is always a reason to want to learn something new even after being with the company for over 5 years. fun people to work with . big warehouse. night shift . nothing else positive . it's making me write more pros however there are none great pay and growth to the top lots of different time off optionsgreat insurance good salary and benefits. interesting work and systems experience. you will loss weight wish is good the pay is good overall , upt and pto challenging, fast paced, excellent salary, supportive team, they give you the ability to drive change and initiative regardless of level or tenure. great people to work with. interesting company. i don't have any pros about this company. getting hired was exciting, i guess. meet some cool people there. flexible time off. you get company stocks. different benefits that are offered are great no one standing over your shoulder as long as productivity goals are met. opportunity to learn multiple functions. great benefits, had employee work incentives and drawings be your own boss....kinda (you aren't paid like one) lots to learn, great people to work with. the day goes by really fast because there is lots to do. very easy to work with people. like the involvement of all team work workers who lift you up to build ur confidence. amazon is a great company to work for in that they provide competitive pay, great benefits, and entice associates with the ability to own a portion of the company. always taken care of - immediate and excellent benefits, amazon wants you to know you are it's money and you are well taken care of 'health wise' so you can keep working. (awesome work amazon!)- if you are a burger lad or dominos dandy the pay here at amazon mixed with the benefits will have you feeling truly like a 'burger king' instead. ($12.50 starting off and it increases up to 3x at $1 a hour i'm to understand.)- at higher \"tiers\" you make more money, regardless of the type of job you do at amazon. amazon is an amazing place to be a slacker since if you work 400% efficiency or 100% you get the same benefits and pay. so the longer you stay at amazon by doing less and keeping your head down, the more paid time off/money/benefits you get. (note: i don't answer for the questionable ethics to be learned from this.)- pickers at amazon are subscribed to one of the most incredible work out programs in the world for leg fitness, you'll be exposed to amazoning personalities that regularly endure the rigors of olympian level marathon hustling. they will train you well.- you will develop 'much' faster hand/eye coordination and reaction time based on brand/size/color/label, even if you are color blind.- the workers and 'good pas/managers' are often very cool down to earth people with a wide spectrum of life experiences and beliefs, which can be really awesome.- the core ethics and moral principles of amazon are profound and inspiring and on every break room wall.- you get awesome pay during official holidays. (thanksgiving and christmas.) especially if you do overtime. i earned nearly $30 an hour during peak time on holidays with overtime. \"thats\" where the gravy is.- free coffee in the break rooms. this will aid you in your quest to make it through 10-12 hour shifts. it is dangerous to go alone, drink this!- people often write hilarious things on the totes. (but management fights this and covers the totes.)- some managers can be really funny and cool people.- sdf8 has smash bros. 'and' guitar hero in the break room, with all their dlc.- supposedly dogs check the facility for and eradicate 'all' the dust mites. according to our management at sdf8. (note: we've never seen said dogs, and cern/darpa are curious as to these 0-dust environments despite warehouse settings, as scientists have yet to achieve this in labs.)- if you are not an american citizen you can get away with most anything at amazon, as long as they can't talk with you. they'll generally not enforce it and \"go out of their way\" to avoid getting you deported home because 'that is mean'. ... hurray...?- amazon is accepting of culture, almost dangerously so. i masqueraded as a \"jedi knight\" for months in various jedi robes and due to islamic people rocking burkas i was unharassed for it and even praised for my dedication to the jedi way.- you will find some of the most ridiculous and hilarious products you have ever seen. also, you'll know 'everything' society buys and how often.- if you're on top of your life, your life situation, your bills, and everything is golden in your life. amazon can be a great place to work, because then $12.50 an hour + benefits and little time/room to grow but plenty of opportunites for random vto/pto/upt is right up your alley!! because fortunately across the year there's many opportunities for 'free time off', a rare commodity at jobs.pro's closing: would i recommend this to a friend? yes! for the long term? no!! amazon is the kind of business where i feel jeff expects the worker to be business savvy/smart and play their cards at \"his\" table. jeff/amazon offers workers help with moving/homes and education and his health benefits are 'incredible' speaking as someone denied them at most lower end jobs. come to amazon expecting to: capitalize as much as possible on health benefits/peak seasons and then if you're able to get a easier going job the rest of the year until peak areas roll back around. don't be a winter soldier like myself and hustle it the entire year unless you find you love it, and it works for you.disclaimer: amazon is not for everyone; it is a very hard job, but if you're a young hard worker and you don't want to flip patties and you are in a dark place -- i'd definitely throw jeff and amazon your way before i would any fast food place. even with this full report. but i'm sending you towards them honest, don't go expecting a easy ride. lots of ability to innovate, drive ideas to implementation, increase your scope, push yourself to do things that most companies could never support. amazing leadership principles to refer to on a daily basis. industry-leading technologies, great project and one of the most talented people i had to work with throughout my career. given the company size, most of decisions are made fast and start from engineers and go bottom-up. amazon provides great benefits and compensation. they reward those who stay in the company longer with better benefits. at the warehouse, the standards are reasonable. lower management is supportive of associates and seek to nurture their growth. great benefits, good coworkers, diverse environment, opportunities to cross train in other positions or departments, career choice program is a great way to help pay for school for associates it is a great place to learn and grow your skills and they put in place a path for you to move forward in your career, despite the business needs. making sure their employees are taken care of is their number 2 priority, second to only customers. there are tons of smart, ambitious, and kind people that work at amazon. it seems like management wants you to succeed. they offer all kinds of tools to help learn new skills and make an internal transfer (if you want to do something else with your career). tons of room for growth. fast progression for motivates workers flexibility, laid back, friendly, convenient, work-life balance, pace is not too bad supervisors are nice and tolerant for your first-time mistakes. good hours and pay, especially if you're a college student product breadth, opportunity to develop and learn is huge. you can work in whatever you are interested in. there is a great website. then there are high performance/scale services which are core part of business. then there is aws, hardware, kindle and the list goes on.it's generally easy to switch teams and moving to other roles is encouraged.mostly smart people around.compensation is competitive and great potential of stock is a silver-lining on the top of that.just loving the company and work. there are great opportunities and the scale at which amazon operates is amazing. fast pace, leading company in the field. fantastic focus on customers. good opportunities for promotion due to company's rapid expansion. lots of projects to work on, they will give you lots of exposure to different things, never boring. some very bright people work there. everything changes quickly and you are expected to stay on top of it all. peak is as busy as you have heard. really good training provided. lots of opportunities for advancement.

at amazon that has experienced anything of the sort. i love it. it's challenging, but i've been rewarded. i work an adjusted schedule that gets me home in time to enjoy after school activities with my kids. like any large corporation amazon has guiding principles, but in amazon's case these are much more deeply ingrained than any company i've worked at before (including other a list tech companies). read them.that being said, it will always come down to the team you're on. i happen to be on an amazing one, so perhaps there are worse out there. while i'm certainly not the guy that

provides the best possible environment for mid-career development.i have had the pleasure of seeing a relatively small business unit grow into an industry leading advertising business in the course of a few years. one of the best things about working at amazon is the opportunity to work on really difficult problems alongside really smart people. the company will heavily invest in any business that shows serious potential for growth and there is never a lack of ambition or mediocrity in the work environment. once you have become a true amazonian other roles outside of the company seem boring and uninteresting, although the phone calls from outside recruiters won't stop coming in which is a pro in case you ultimately decide to you want leave.i would highly recommend this potential opportunity for any freshly minted mba. advancement opportunitiesheat people to work with autonomy, customer focused, innovative culture good hours and everything but i dont see myself working here long-term the

work was slow, the supervisors would ask people if they wanted to leave early and even encouraged people to take time off & if they stayed then they'd be forced to pressure people or scare them so they will want to leave on their own by week 2 of working there. so if you hate it or sense something is wrong, you can use that time to look for work elsewhere. off the bat you can take a lot of

the worse) allows you to think and use thought in your daily activity. i really like working four ten hour shifts and being able to get overtime. i also like the clean bathroom. it's a job and we all have bills to pay overtime hours were a plus which would make the paychecks worth it. 10 hour work days so you do get 3 days off, but that is only when it is not busy. during the winter, it gets

additional hours you work- your managers of the department are always helpful and they will always try to make you feel better(that really depends on the manage since i've had ones i could rely on and

of art technologies while working for supply chain management. it helped me in many ways in later stages. best salary / perks benefitsopportunity to handle multiples projectsbrand namecooperative leadership open environment, u can do a lot amazon is a great place to learn about lots of interesting and hard software problems like massively scalable distributed systems, personalization, internationalization, user traffic analysis and data mining. the sheer scale of amazon makes software development rewarding: millions of people will use your code (or find your bugs). the code you write can have a significant impact on both people and profits. you will also get exposure to many cutting edge industry problems that give you very marketable, appealing skills as a software engineer. when moving from amazon to other tech companies, i was surprised at how highly regarded my experience at amazon was, and how useful what i learned there has become at later stages in my career.the company overall is very analytical about everything it does- absolutely everything is measured, and decisions are made based on data, not feelings or politics. all projects and individual performance are evaluated against the same set of technical and leadership corporate values. everyone is held accountable all the time for the measured quality of their work, which forces yearly evaluation and rewards to be quite fair.the workplace environment overall is good- management is very aggressive about enforcing standards of good conduct amongst employees, and the engineering community is very vibrant and collaborative. it has the feel of a startup in many ways, even though it is a multi-thousand person company. the developer community in particular is great- the density of smart people is very high, and there are more opportunities than a single person could take advantage of to broaden their tech knowledge and skills.the benefits and compensation are also generous. amazon is a very innovative company with never a dull moment at work. management greatly encourages new ideas/technology, given that you can get some free time off your operational load (see below). the company has some of the smartest people around and provides awesome learning and career growth opportunities. if you ever wonder what does it take to keep a large scale distributed system working where the customer never even realizes the machinery behind amazon.com, you need to come work at amazon. great place to work at, learn some new stuff and have fun while doing it. amazon totally rocks! good name and good experience. you get to work with a good number of smart, driven individuals. as a young software engineer, there aren't many places that will pay you like amazon. the pay is very, very good. figured i would get that out there up front.i have a good deal of freedom with my job, and with small exceptions, i haven't been overburdened with long hours, either. from talking with other employees from other teams, and reading these reviews, i think it is somewhat the luck of the draw with amazon - because teams are very independant and decentralized, your experience with one team can be wildly different from another. luckily, i believe i am on a very good one.management has been great, in my experience. my manager is a coder/manager, so while he isn't the best project manager i've ever worked with, he works very hard to understand what is going on at a low level with the team, without micromanaging. i rarely have had to deal with upper management, and when i do, the experience has been positive.work/life balance has also been good. my team is very understanding and somewhat liberal when it comes to giving time off when necessary. the schedule is also very flexible, we can come and go as we please, work from home when necessary, etc.amazon's recruiting process brings in the best and brightest. i have yet to meet an sde at amazon tha i thought \"slipped through the cracks\" and didn't belong. everyone at the company seems capable of contributing at a high level. you work with lots of smart people who really want to do a good job.we really are customer focused, which makes you proud of the work you've done at the end of a long day.nearly limitless possibilities for moving around internally and learning new skills. amazon is doing a bunch of things that are really at the cutting edge of information technology. massive scale? check. cloud computing? check. utility web services? check. internet media? check. you get the freedom to do amazing things. (mind you, along with that comes the responsibility to do them right.) that's from the engineering point of view. i can't really comment on the retail and supply chain parts of the business. very bright people. i have never been bored. you can see the results of your work quickly. innovation is encouraged. developers have the opportunity to use new technologies. the private book signings with authors that are offered to employees are great. fast paced dynamic environment.smart co-workers.strong sense of ownership in the decentralized model lends itself to designing and writing better software.flexibility to explore alternate career paths. amazon is still growing, and there are a lot of great teams to work on. if you pick the right team with the right manager, there's a lot of opportunity to work on fun things like aws or digital services, and get recognized and rewarded for your achievements. some of the other highlights include: weekly tech talks to educate engineers on what's going on in the industry or to talk about a cool new technology that a team is working with, \"fishbowls\" - where popular authors or artists come to talk about their latest books and albums and of course, all the benefits of working in downtown (or close to it) seattle.the dreaded pager duty that many amazonians complain about again depends on the team you work on. on a large team, you can foresee being on pager duty once every 6-8 weeks. if your software service is critical and has a penchant for going down, this can definitely be hell. for some teams, where the service is not critical (support for internal teams, for example) or not prone to outages, pager duty can be considered a mild inconvenience. easy relaxed environment, no pressure to showup. leadership is helpful and supportive. flexible work environment. great smart people work here at amazon. good work environment and good team environment i get to work at home, i'm trained in a ton of different areas. the pay was higher then most other call centers. fast-paced environment. relationship-building opportunities with people from all diverse backgrounds, oversee large group of people even though you may be inexperienced. learn the ins and outs of the largest supply chain company in the industry. great ambitious plans and project. co-workers are typically smart and hardworking. stock prices have been good. best bonus is the office is a dog friendly environment. there are none so i can not give any pros pay was decent, easily hire supportive sales manager and resources to tap into. many brands want to work with amazon, which offers multiple relevant products. product specialists are knowledgable! rewarding, in a very immediate, direct sense: working in the .com division, there is always the knowledge that you've given something their product on time and in good condition. if you've ever ordered something on amazon.com, you know how nice that is, and given the sheer number of packages we ship out in one day (or even one shift), you're making a lot of people happy. stocks, co-workers, hours, regular raises for first three years, 3-day weekends, flexibility of shifts, overtime during holidays, time off system. good pay great benefits day one fast paced. lots of motivated and intelligent coworkers. culture is customer and data driven, rather than “pm driven” like other companies that hire software engineers.good management will make sure you’re spending time on meaningful projects. love the work schedule, safe environment, clean work, good people and management and good opportunity to grow professionally not too much pressure and working environment is good great benefits, fun people fun people to work with. short work weeks. approachable leadership. consistency and bonuses are good. excellent facilities management is generally friendly and supportive and the career choice program helps a lot to further your career - you will work harder than you ever have in your life. but only for the 4 days a week you work- company is good about promoting people who work hard (1 yr for l4>l5, 2 more for l5>l6 is standard)- given a lot of power/responsibility at a name-brand company. looks good for resume.- cancel the gym membership lol. red bull becomes water and cliff bars are your entire diet.- good amounts of vacation time - but \"work so hard, forgot how to vacation\" is super relevant- not too bad except for peak, which is kind of really bad but also only like 1.5 months- come in humble and without an agenda or be hated- super competitive job, but that’s the fun part. fast paced, innovative, with strong leadership this company has a great culture about it and was a joy to work for, would recommend. -lots of responsibility-good pay for an internship-a great chance at career advancement within amazon-internship is well wortht the stress culture of change. challenging the status quo. try different solutions to problem solving. if you work hard they will reward you, the pay is very good for warehouse work and promotions are there if you work hard and play the politics right. surrounded by smart, talented, hard working people. decent pay, good locations in seattle, moving to a new 11 building campus soon. the pay is ok, but you are treated like crap. there is favoritism no matter what. fast paced culture steep learning curve, casual environment, surrounded by smart individuals. some of the smartest peers i have ever had. problems can be complex and solving them can be very rewarding. jeff bezos has a great vision.these are the smartest, most motivated, and professional people that i have ever worked with.amazon puts the customer first.there are a bunch of great projects to work on. work with smart, driven people, get paid extremely well, and for company growing at an amazing rate. it is a place with very interesting technical challenges ---if you are looking for great technical problems and bright people to work with, then this is the right place. also it has a get-things-done culture: things develop very rapidly and it is a short distance from idea to execution. easy tasks to complete, very achievable productivity minimums, flexible managers it is a great company full of smart ambitions people. benefits aren't bad, there is stock options keeps you in shape and busy, all the time theres something to do. paid time off, unpaid time off, and benefits as wellalso after a year you will be able to take free college classes. great environment and good vibes a competitive atmosphere, focused on productivity. work with the best people in the business great energy, fast learning curve, self-starter culture strong talent; big dreams; supportive teammates free thanksgiving dinner, overtime, prizes during holidays interesting problems and room to learn and grow stock value (for now) and opportunity to cross orgs good to work there on daily basis. amazing benefits. health, dental, and vision insurance less than $50 every two weeks. insurance begins immediately upon hire. upon getting hired you start with vacation time, unpaid time, and personal paid time off. excellent management and hr team on back half 3rd shift at cha2. outbound pick department is easy to learn. very fast paced work which makes the night go by quicker. vto (voluntary time off) offered if it gets slow, but you can stay if you like. 4 days/10 hour shifts. 3 days off. i have been working there for 1 year 7 months and love it. literally the easiest job to get hired for. no resume needed. anyone can work here.most co-workers are great working on the battlefield together. most flex drivers are good too. - dogs are allowed- urban campus- high salaries and benefits- amazon makes your boss and managers have promotions and hires approved by external people who are brought to identify biases 1. the people at amazon are amazing; the culture among the lower level staff is great. almost everyone is incredibly friendly, very helpful, and very hardworking. there are a lot of people who are stars; they can do any task no matter how complex, and they are always willing to help you out or share their knowledge.2. many of the people managers are also wonderful, they care deeply about their employees and their development, although they are limited by amazon's organizational structure. very smart talented people. do your home work and reap the benefits. you can speak your mind, provide honest feedback and not feel like you have to be a yes man. amazon in general is an innovative company and the opportunities for professional growth are unlimited - both within and beyond your current role. my current team members are supportive, intelligent, and motivated. the work-life balance is also outstanding. i had an amazing time working with amazon. many learning and growth opportunities. if you are talented and interested, you can move to any field in amazon. work culture is at par with any other company. i am interster e-commerce website in work and i am amazon seller.but change job. instills practices and attitudes that have been immensely valuable in my career interesting and energetic job role at amazon you can move to a completely new field where in other companies you'd need relevant experience. they just want to know that you're a good worker. the summer party is also great. pros:in the words of dan pink (motivation) the things that make us happy in work are not just focused around money. pay people well enough to take money of the list of concerns and what motivates staff?autonomy, mastery, and purpose.i worked at amazon web services for 2 years as a solutions architect and i can say hand on heart, it was the best job, working for the best company ever. let me explain in a little more detail as to why this is fact ;)autonomy:no micro management from the team leaders, bosses, peers, but a wealth of support in all aspects from career aspirations to soft skills and everything in between.it's day one right!? sure was for me - ideas welcomed and occasionally i thought of something that someone else had not thought off - this was a rare thing ;) none of that malaise that creeps in and stifles growth (personal and company) to the point that you can’t wait till the end of the month and dread getting up in the morning.you are not spoon fed anything. go out and seize the day to make you and amazon better each time. you are responsible for carving out your own destiny. yes, this puts more work on you, but is there really any other way?mastery:such a wealth of training, support, mentoring, career planning was offered to me it was a real inclusive feeling. “what would you like to do long term?” was a question asked of me by my sa manager at the time. we had a one hour conversation on what do i really want, how he would be able to support these objectives. if you have ever done the “five x why’s?”, you will understand just how difficult a question this line of questioning is. suffice to say, the manager really got me thinking and helped me plan out the next few years of my career – thanks pf. there was plenty of self-paced training available as well as instructor lead training to ensure that i was always at the top of my game. great opportunities to apply this knowledge to customer questions and peers.purpose:the most customer centric company on the planet is a high accolade to achieve and maintain. with the leadership principles (lp) in place you know what is expected from you before you even start from a cultural point of view. i knew what was expected from me and when i was failing, the support was there from my line manager (who is one of the best people that has managed this employee) in buckets. regularly taking time out to ensure that things were going well from both perspectives. my role was clear and a real sense of purpose to go out and achieve, but how i delivered was not prescriptive – see autonomy.overall:working and aws is not easy. with the wealth of information that you need to absorb to the number of customers clambering for guidance, you will always be busy (but this is a good thing). if you are looking to kick back and do enough to get by, don't apply to work here, you will not enjoy it. if you don’t agree with the lp’s, again, don’t apply. on the other hand, if you delight in being challenged, being given the opportunity to shine and delivering, look no further and get to amazon jobs to find that role that you know you could smash.i have read a few reviews about wlb (work/life balance) and i can honestly say that whilst there is pressure to work, work, work, you need to \"have the backbone and disagree (lp)\" when the balance in not quite right. i did just this very thing and support was given instantly to address this area. this is not a just local line manager taking pity, but a directive from the very top to ensure that we strike the right balance. we are all individuals and have different needs at different times. it is not easy to get this right all the time, but when it was going in the wrong direction for me, a conversation was all it took to get the results i needed to support me and my family and the wlb was restored. no dramas, no fuss, happy employer and employee.there are so many other elements to the role that are not understood from the outside looking in, so here are a few of the things that just add more value to me that make me a better person and therefore a better employee:events:supporting events like summits, partner workshops, team meetings are great as you get to meet a lot of different people and improve your understanding of what aws customers and peers are talking/thinking about. the ability to flex your technical and soft skills and know that you are giving your customers a great experience is so rewarding that you look forward to the next one as soon as it finishes, despite being exhausted. thinking is hard ;)interviews:you are interviewing your peers. you have a big say in who will be joining your team. this was fantastic for me as we have all worked in places where new comers are simply thrust upon you to \"deal with\". being an integral part of the hiring team was a great revelation both in terms of the empowerment, but the insights that interviewing gives you. interviews becomes a cycle of improving your interviews, improving yourself to conduct better interviews, improving yourself to ensure that you live up to the standards you are expecting from candidates.tech:wow – i could write pages on this element, but suffice to say that the pace is relentless. there is no way that you could not fail to be impressed with the sheer pace of innovation. you are actively encouraged to add to this innovation and we are even given time to take a break from our busy schedules for the sole purpose of coming up with the next great innovation. the hard part is keeping up and for a geek like me…

great benefits, awesome start pay, easy job, hr really works with you, and the company is mother and maternity friendly which is awesome. i personally like the hours, but during peak it can get overwhelming, but we have plenty of pto/vto to help set that off. everyone is friendly, and the facility is super clean and they are always looking for employee feedback which is awesome. i like the ambassadors, who essentially are there for when you need help or need questions answered. they answer to their best ability, or look for someone who can help you. i love the people that i work with! the experiences that i have had at this job are invaluable. the work can be strenuous and teadious at times but it is to be expected being that it is a warehouse. great environment to work in. many areas are either industry-leading (e.g. online retail, aws) or offer a fairly unique take (e.g. cheap devices backed by the vast amazon content ecosystem). this creates both a big space to play in and a lot of opportunities to work on features spanning multiple businesses.also, very honest about company values. customer obsession, long-term thinking, and the leadership principles are really how things work (in my experience), not a pr campaign or something. get a chance to learn new technologies, a good start for your first job. good compensation, intelligent colleagues, strong engineering practices, exposure to broad range of technologies. above market compensation, world class learning opportunities, networking with talented and ambitious individuals, fantastic resume builder, and

major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. no dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome speed of innovation, transparency, culture of experimentation and fail fast, true customer obsession its very fast moving and challenging environment. i learned a lot in last 1 year compared to probably 2 to 3 years in my previous companies. i am glad i choose amazon over others. huge aspirations, absolute rejection of barriers, and a constant desire to do better! everything was awesome. great communication. i work around some of the smartest people in the tech industry who are truly customer obsessed. other companies talk about customer obsession, but amazon (aws) really delivers. overall, i would describe aws as a big company that moves like a high-growth start-up. lots to learn, lot of initiatives, your colleagues are really smart easy job and fast paced fast paced, lots of innovation, room for growth if you are willing to relocate. very good resume builder. lots of learning and dealing with grey areas. they pay you decently, but not really for the work you have to do. the health care packages are decently priced. lots of hands on experience with a variety of technologies. 4x10 schedule at most sites. fast paced. opportunities to work on multiple high level projects, travel to new site builds. plenty of room to take ownership and a variety of areas. lots of focus on career development. unless you steal or make a threat, your job is very secure. you get to have a well known fortune 500 company on your resume flexible hours but it changes from team to team very accommodating to permanent employees. lots of hours and overtime being at amazon fulfillment i learned how to set goals and pace my work building has climate control, good medical benefits, keeps you in shape, people are hardworking and nice, nice break rooms and accessible and clean bathrooms. weekly pay.voluntary time off (vto) and voluntary extra time (vet) opportunities.work equipment provided for free.flexible for school purposes. working on aws as a software development engineer has given me the tools to understand the complexity of a running and supporting a cloud service. these tools have made me a better professional, my available resources are abundant, and there's still room for improvement. easy to do just keep your rates up mistakes are fixable good health 401 k life insurance benefits work/life balance, autonomy, limited politics, merit based promotions, tons of opportunities -employee discounts-management is fairly productive and knows how to get everyone moving at a good pace-kinda fun to have a look at all the different items that everyone orders job security, set hours, 3 days off, big break rooms, friendly managers solid company and a marketing culture that ensures future success in an ever changing economy. pay is good and sufficient at amazon they have pretty good benefits ,and it’s a somewhat easy job if u don’t work hard then ur great! saftey is a number one priority. provide fun activities when things are getting busy. benefits start on day 1. stocks you get are great but if you leave the company before you have access to them, you get nothing. new hire orientation was fun and informative as well as the yearly amazon corporate meeting held in seattle. makes you really feel like you are part of something! it's amazon and that's about it. amazon is like my former company. it is okay and perfect for me. professional company with high standard policies. easy to save money with all mandatory overtime. great benefits. very nice people and culture. been here less than a year. hope to be here a long time. what a great great company -just about every job here can be learned in a day- they do give extra pay for overnight workers-they actually weed out the lazy workers as best they can- make it easy to change shifts when available-sometimes they give gift cards for working longer hours-my current managers do the best they can to ensure the safety of employees in every form decent pay for what you are doing amazon has some great benefits (salary, healthcare, stock, etc...). 1. good work environment2.good package for a non technical3.good perks good environment to work here informal organizationhigh growth opportunitygood salarygood extrasfree work flowinteresting workno hierarchyno dress codelively work floorgood transport nice peers, new challenges every day, inspiring people, interesting company, amazon discount 10%, feedback culture. free work enviroment. and young employee crowd entrepreneurial culture, highly talented folks to work with i had good experience through amazone...they deliver products too fast n original nice company to work for. ample opportunities. canteen food was okay at lunchtime. some colleagues were good people to be around. money is good, initially. but if you stick around for more than two years, your salary actually reduces because the joining bonus component is missing. amazon is a great place for innovators. we are always pushing the boundaries of what is possible and we value employees who are able to help chart the course of the future. amazon is also filled with high performers who continually raise the bar. people who like being challenged to learn and grow will love amazon. affordable health benefits and great equity package-fast paced and challenging but rewarding environment-very diverse management workforce-plenty of autonomy-non traditional work environment. (laid back, no strict dress code)-plenty of opportunities for career development opportunity - both within every team, and the ability to move teams for career direction is simple and huge given the vast amount of interesting challenges teams are working on and variety of roles available as we continue to growdown to earth people / great culture - i've been impressed with the character of people i meet. my biggest worry leaving the small company world was facing politics, bureaucracy, and dicks. been very happy with the intelligence and humility of the people i run into.work-life balance and ownership: i've simply never been with a company that gives employees as much free reign (save the start up i worked with)the work: literally changing how people go about life, and inventing new ways of doing things.ownership / open to changing how things are done: i can come up with an idea and put it through the steps to eventually present to leadership if it's good enough. i've seen it done by a friend. that's pretty cool.mentors: people very open to connect with and very open to offering their time.random: there are famous people that come informally to give talks in seattle every few days. amazon can be a challenging environment and is not for everyone, especially if you do not want to work hard and be all in. if you are willing to put in the effort, amazon is extremely rewarding and allows one to do far bigger things here than you could anywhere else in the same fields! the amount of ambition internally here is striking. amazon is not afraid of having long term vision and taking huge bets.you have a lot of responsibility, but with it comes a tremendous amount of opportunity and ownership. there is a ton of autonomy. you will be able to influence policy, standard, process, etc. it is always day 1 so \"it has always been done that way\" does not handcuff you from making real change. health insurance and benefits, 401k, and a stable work schedule (excluding july, and october to december)if you want a steady job, and are okay with extremely repetitive tasks, this is a good position. time off is good for job very fast paced and never a dull moment. tons of learning experiences and opportunity to advance your career. project ownershipcool projectsstrong future for company great culture, fast paced and learning environment you get to do you own thing and have options to work across different roles. okay pay, pto, upt, vacation, etc. amazing work and career growth opportunities. working from home. flexible schedule. great management. support is always there and questions are always answered. really great people to work with, enjoyed learning picking. benefits are great! with in to learn something new. never worked in a warehouse before. the companies level of prestige pay is awesome and can get raised i think the best things about working here is the shift times ,the wage and the fact that you can request to work any schedule to suit your needs. i work three doubles and am off 4 days. shifts here are 4hr and being p\\t i can only work up to 6 shifts a week. i was originally a p\\t seasonal employee but when conversion to blue badge was offered,i was only 2days past my 90 and was sitting on 4 attendance points . conversion was only open for 1 week,i put in for it and was hired. my wage went up and i have better benefits. my job is a fulfillment associate 1 in the sort center. i basically put boxes and packages on pallets that will be sent to various post offices for delivery. it is hard work and you are walking ,walking, walking . you do have a quota and you will slim down and firm up. you get a set schedule with amazing benefits from day one. but the people you work with are very interesting and you see a lot of interesting items that people sell on amazon. it's pretty fun working here! as long as you hit your rate and you don't use all your upt then it's a great job to work for. after one year of employment it's i believe 90% tuition reimbursement for certain associates degrees. they do random opportunities throughout the year to encourage employees to work hard and stay on task. occasionally they will do bingo for prizes, basketball shoot out for prizes, and ping-pong tournaments for prizes all during the lunch break. they also have power hour where you work as fast as you can for one hour in your department and the highest rated person gets rewarded with sometimes gift cards, swag bucks to purchase amazon swag at hr, and plenty of other opportunities to be rewarded for your work. - so many

different experience than i have.---no matter what team you join, you will be working with people who are smart. even if you think that you are the best in certain fields, there are always people you can learn from.amazon is really fast paced, so you will see huge projects get quickly shipped out the door. rather than spend years perfecting a product, amazon is willing to take risks and fix things after getting things launched (with minimal customer impact).amazon truly is customer-focused. a lot of the time the first question that is being asked is: how will this affect the customer?there are so many teams at amazon, that you can constantly switch teams to try out completely new things. although they require you to stay with a team for at least one full year, that's pretty much what i did. i hopped around trying out different things. you can control your stress level and hours worked the only pro to working at amazon is that you can bring your dog to work and only if you are chained to your desk all day as dogs are not allowed in conference rooms and common areas. this company cares about their employees and make sure its a relaxed environment to work in surrounded by driven individuals. nobody thinks their work is unimportant, no matter the scope of their work. flexible hours- during orientation you get to pick which days and hours work best for you.great pay- weekly pay

very cool work environment. have plenty of opportunity to grow carrier wise...as i have just joined 3 months ago, i felt this is a very good company to have fun!!! its an amazing workplace. its a wonderful platform to learn,work,grow and fun filled environment.i am a proud amazonian :) amazon's hiring is the most critical thing as they hire the best. amazon's cukture is the best and it gives opportunity for every employee to move around and get experience in their desired filed within the company. amazon spends a lot on development starting from an associate level to senior management level by various development training programs which no other company does. this is the best company to work with forever,thank you amazon. you will always find something new to learn/do which will help you improve your career. culture and people - just can't be said enough about amazon culture. the leadership principles that guide everything that is done at amazon are very well thought through and are adhered to well by all employees. some of the best minds in the world work for amazon making everybody learn something new every single day not that sure still it is fine work life balance very good the engineers are generally quite good. benefits are really good. pay is not the greatest but most people don't work there to make it a career anyway. amazon maintains a very high-bar for performance, which means employees are incredibly intelligent and driven to build the best customer experience possible. amazon also runs particularly lean so there is a tremendous amount of responsibility and business given right off the bat. i worked for smx and i got converted to amazon at cvg3 in kentucky. people were aswome to work with, and the pay was pretty good. time off was semi convient. and if you were amazon blue badge you got what they call vcp pay, which is at the end of the month your second pay check. i get a paycheck but its really looking like i will leave after my vesting. very engaging, fast paced environment. it's amazon! in general, they pay well - especially if you are in a management position. moving up is easy if you are willing to put in the work. i was an intern here for six months, and being surrounded by people from places like stanford, booth and ivy league schools was a bit daunting at first, but you quickly learn that this company is not hierarchical at all. on the contrary, it's a launchpad for anyone hungry to grow in responsibility and experience, since there is always opportunity lying around just waiting to be seized. i have been at amazon for much less than a year. during my first review period, only 6 months in, i received a raise. you can make decent money during the peak season. working with others being able to learn different functions pay rate was a plus get to meet people from all walks of life. most managers are friendly. compared to food, retail, cna, this min wage job is not bad. this job can replace your gym. meeting new and different people great work atmosphere in the company it is a great company to work for. very fast paced with high expectations of their employees however i believe the goals set were obtainable. fun and exciting place to work. making history and being part of a global team is fun. the people i work with are terrific. great place to learn... not a great place for a work life balance types. salary not that bad at all a place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about cs. good benefits, guaranteed hours, nice pay plus bonus, paid time off and paid holidays. the company has good benefits and the freedom to leave early with your banked time. high hiring bar, opportunity to experiment and do some interesting work that make impact on the business. ability to bring dogs to work. good culture clearly defined for employees through the leadership principles. high hiring bar so you work with really smart people. bezos and (most of) the rest of the senior management team takes the long view, so you really are empowered to do the right thing. customer-focused culture is pretty cool. great customer base, passion around the operations side of the business. always innovating for better customer experience. ok pay, benefits, bonuses, and tips. lots of benefits and activities. great pay and benefits packages for managers medical benifits, employee discounts, reasonable pay, paid time off, vacation time. - 3 day weekends (most of the time)- flexible- work with very smart people- great opportunity to move up in the company-

you can tap into a huge amount of knowledge. 10 hour shifts, great pay and benefits, coworkers are nice, and helping people with their orders it's an huge learning opportunity. some of the technology and innovations you can't find anywhere else. pay is extremely good. +the pay+friendly co-workers+arcade, lots of drinks and food in the break room.+friendly and understanding managers. not boring, fast paced, room to grow. it is what you put into it. a vast array of opportunities to further your career path. full time, pay is ok , benefits from day 1, paid time off from day 1 higher than minimum wage payment. there are no pros. this job was not fun and i watched management take team managers and demote them back down to on-phone tech. a good place to work the customer truly is #1--as a csa, i have the authority to do just about whatever i think is right to make our customers happy (which makes me happy). the dress code is uber casual (yup, you can wear your pjs to work), it's not a homogeneous group of employees, schedule changes are relatively easy, the environment is fun, and everyone is expected to have a sense of ownership in the company. most employees are friendly and more than happy to help one another out with job performance issues and even a ride to work. good pay and compensation. big company and reputation. people are very nice and friendly and smart. working in a smaller site everyone knows each other and most have been there for years. the leadership team works hard to maintain the amazon leadership principle and they're a motivated team. the company has great benefits and opportunities. the only pros about the job were the pay and benefits. amazon makes cool software. if you time your moves right, there is a fair amount of mobility between teams within the company. good pay relative to other minimum wage and wharehouse jobs. good pay, enjoyed the exercise, gave senior citizens a chance too work, loved the management in outbound shipping. amazon has a unique culture with unique values of ownership, customer obsessions, bias for action, invent and simplify, etc. there is plenty of opportunities for learning, trying new things, and growth if you know where to look for them. it is a fast-paced environment that presents new challenges everyday. you are encouraged to dive in, to take ownership, to disagree, to challenge yourself and others. you work with and learn from very bright people from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives that broaden your views daily. you work with different technical problems and challenges at the \"amazon scale\" which can be unique in the industry. working here can be a tremendously rewarding experience. amazon is always on the front end of technology. lots of exciting things happening there across many different product lines. it's also easy to move around from team to team and position to position. wonderful work environmenthuge bonusesfriendly colleaguesfast growth brand name , good opportunities for growth, smart people , cool and friendly culture , work environment and definitely handsome package growth and development. changes and rapid learning. updates and improvememts. so many teams to pick from.can position yourself to work with hardcore technical stuffreasonable salary amazing company to serve indian population - you work together with very smart people- you learn a lot from day 1 and you constantly learn- you feel appreciated for what you do- you feel challenged day by day and never find yourself bored- you have access to tons of information about cool new services and products- great opportunities for self-growing, amazon itself wants that the employees advance and grow within the company. global company but lacking in alot of areas. good work, decent pay, decent peer group sometimes \"managers\" leave you leftovers in the kitchen. woof-woof.peers are nice. free coffee. work life balance is not good the pay is good, and the benefits are even better. vacation pay is also a huge plus as well too. amazon is military friendly. they really take in account the leadership and experience you gain while you served or still serving. starting salaries are on the higher end of the spectrum and bonuses and benefits are great! my teammates are smart, interesting, and nice. i joined straight out of college, and a lot of my teammates were much older (with kids), but we have gotten along great. i'm proud to call them my teammates in the office, and some of us spend time together outside of work as well. i work as a solutions architect for amazon web services. this has been an amazing opportunity for me. i help customers on a daily basis to make positive changes for their businesses. for many companies the 'core values' are something on a web page, at amazon, we live the leadership principles, especially rule #1 customer obsession.i have worked for aws for a year and a half, the job is never boring. new services are constantly coming out, so there is always something new and interesting to learn and play with. every customer is different so your skills will spread.culture in the office i work at is amazing. everyone is ready and willing to help you, or point you in the right direction. the two managers i have reported to have been some of theist in my career. (especially since they both did the job before they managed the job.) i've not had a single bit of negative feedback that wasn't reverent and useful.on a personal more personal note, there have been two instances, a family emergency and a family tragedy in my time working for amazon. in both cases my team supported me 100%.the job is what you make of it. if you challenge yourself to constantly improve this is the place for you. after a year and a half, it may not seem like it's still 'day 1' thankfully... but maybe month 1.would i recommend the job? absolutely, and i have several times.

tasks its a job. i guess i absolutely love the group i'm on and adore my team members. everyone is super helpful and ready to answer my questions. i've learned a ton since i started (i'm an intern) and enjoy my project. my manager, mentor, and skip-level have 1:1s with me every single week, to talk about my career goals, issues i might be facing, etc - essentially, the meeting is mine to do with what i wish. also, working from home is an option - not all the time, since asking questions is way easier in person, but if you need to do so occasionally, they're okay with it. i'm surrounded by some of the smartest people i know. they help me elevate my game. no politics. i get to help invent the future of retail. if you are willing to learn, they are willing to teachflexible hours paid

treated like an adult, freedom to do you job as you know how, not micro-managed. you are given reins to excel.3) stock incentives and sign-on bonuses fantastic (but salary only so-so)4) everyone here is outstanding -- helpful, engaged, whip smart. you will think to yourself \"how did they let me in here?\"5) very strong focus on customers and making their businesses better. it is a winning formula, as evidenced by tremendous growth of aws.6) strong culture of the leadership principles (google it). they are lived every day. if you want to win a debate/discussion with other employees, remind them how their position is not in keeping with a specific lp. works almost every time.7) huge career opportunities. aws is growing so fast, we have hundreds of openings. moving around is supported. decent pay and hours , benefits. -challenging projects-very smart people-flexible great associates, plenty of work. good money, good benefits, good food choices for catering during lunch. the technology infrastructure is absolutely fantastic! the build, deploy, collaborate, monitor and operate tools are just the best! the heart and soul of what makes aws is at the tip of your fingertips --- fully visible, hackable and readable.i like to think of amazon as being the smallest big company. the org structure is highly decentralized to the point where variance in team processes, culture and even budget for lunch is different everywhere.but underneath it all is the exact same leadership principles that guide everybody. even to the point where other companies in the world have in one way or another straight out copied amazon's leadership principles! why wouldn't they! it's the best way to run a company. i've worked at amazon for over a year now and really like it. exceptionally smart people are the norm. the overall approach to creatively inventing ways around obstacles is refreshing -- my coworkers aren't routinely defeated by operational challenges. the pace of change is fast, which is also refreshing. when projects don't go as planned, we have thoughtful conversations about what we learned and will do differently going forward. it's a very pragmatic, rational approach to getting great work done, and i find that this resonates well with how i am wired. people expect that you will provide feedback regularly on how they can better embody amazon's 14 leadership principles, and also expect that you can handle feedback in a mature manner. this means problems are addressed and can be fixed, and helps to avoid a culture of grumbling where people aren't satisfied but no one will take action to solve an issue. there are very big opportunities to tackle, which is exciting if you like building things. aws is an outstanding technology with the full force of amazon's brand recognition driving customer adoption. highly driven and smart group that is open to leading with the best ideas versus seniority. high pay is also a major plus. the people i have worked with in 1.5 years at amazon are good collaborators. they are engaged, principled, and candid. people at amazon take responsibility for their mistakes, give credit where it is due, and find ways to make those around them successful. people here don't seem to complain ever, they just identify what can be made better and make it happen. strong culture; lots of new people, encourages new ideas; truly obsessed with customers; walks the walk not just talks to the talk team concept. respect for all. challenging the individual to be better. great benefits and salary. room for growth. face paced. amazon is the most dynamic company i have ever seen. though the company is one of the biggest in the technology domain, it is still agile. every day is the opportunity to build new things and learn. $17.50/hr msp1 bhn great friends can be made here.this warehouse will develop your character and professionalism in its own way. easy work, overnight shifts, fun people amazon provides a good salary and good benefits, with lots of opportunity to move up in the company. i feel supported from my team and supervisors. i feel confident in my job security and am proud to be a part of such a successful company they offer benefits from day one and a willing to work with you on the days you need. not to many places like this. - work on very cool projects and have an impact on the company- very intelligent and competent employees- good mission/vision that is communicated across the company- opportunities to move in the company and work with different teams and projects- great company to work for if you have limited experience and want to learn a lot very quickly plenty of opportunities to move on up its good for recent graduated students, its nothing complicated,after 3 month training you are all set and good to go very straight forward job, benefits immediately, fast pace, very little contact with leadership, four day work week, overtime possible, shift deferential good base pay, various shifts, tolerable management high pay, good benefits, lots to do high salary, benefits, raises yearly. great work environment where the majority of the associates are happy with their jobs and enjoy the work they do. one of the pros working at amazon is that you are expected to have a complete ownership of whatever you are doing, and there isn't a lot of hand-holding either. you are expected to sort of \"get-it\" and start contributing right away. great health insurance - best in the industry. -keine langeweile-soziale

go from a developers desktop to working in production in just hours. the company values and mission statement aren't just aspirational clap-trap, but affect day to day activities, and decisions. i am

days but was10 hours shift's-good pay if you get hours, christmas period usually in the beginning it was challenging and little support given from supervisors as they except you to pick up rather quickly with the threat of being moved to nights. it comes down to whether your manager/supervisor likes you to how quick you progress/learn. the company has a lot of favoritism i was the only operational assistant on my pm shift and at first i had one colleague join me; both were trained the same but one of my supervisors which was close to the manager favored him slightly. after that supervisor become manager and our old manager got promoted to senior manager it became much more evident.to the degree that my manager tried to get rid of me by complaining to my agency supervisor that my performance is not up to standard. were it not for the other supervisor whom stood up for me they would have long fired me.at the end after a few months i realised my quality of life is affected by this working environment and left the company which felt like the best choice i ever made in my life. good pay an time flies bye fast an it not hard work at all you will be working with

you get paid weekly free arcade game in break room good people need more good people disclaimer: my opinions reflect that of an sde in amazon. seems like some operational job functions are very tough.i have read through some of the other amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! this is so true. within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. i think i am more of the balanced type as i try to stay sane. the amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be.pros in amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. we get a free orca card to take any bus in the seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401k contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. not so great. staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. it is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. they count as part of your 5 personal days per year. listing the benefits of amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros.work life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. no one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. i have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. if you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but i can't say how many people are working how long. the view on work life balance is a bit skewed. all it comes down to are the managers and what they think. projects are always never-ending but i have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. everyone needs a break.on-call really really sucks. basically all it comes down to is having sdes double-duty as support operations engineers. note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. the on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. if the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. the code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in amazon. searching through the amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse.integration is the name of the game in amazon. you will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. i have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. it is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive.amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. this reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. if the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? you can see new faces around the amazon building almost everyday! downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an amazonian sde certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. i think the world is not turning up enough sdes and the only way is for quality to go downhill.as an sde, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. in most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. note that amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. you will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. to me, this seems to make sense because i have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and i did not feel it was a good use of my time.internal mobility is a key strength of amazon, and i am not sure which company has done better than amazon in this aspect. internal moves are easy. you only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. there is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time!seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the bay area.overall amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. the flexibility of this company is really its core strength. you have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. bummer. you shouldn't be slacking! work cultureprinciplesgood learning curvegood work life balance fun, easy jobs, very physical, lose weight. the benefits are absolutely fantastic! easy to get hired, job is not difficult, great benefits. you get to work from home opportunity to move around, good pay, challenging work and really smart engineers. you own your career. -good hourly pay-quiet area-nothing else pay is okay . garented lots of hours. 3 days off. the health benifets are ok this is a good e-commerce company easy 'manual' labor, nice facilities, good management good insurance, stock offered, and monthly bonuses working with a very very diverse range of people for great leadership with many may ways to escalate to a higher position - most of the bs office culture so prevalent in silicon valley is not present in south lake union (but, see first 'con' below).- robust dialogue regarding design decisions is strongly encouraged, and sdes at all levels tend to participate in such dialogues (but, see second 'con' below). love the benefits and perks! very reasonable and generous employer, they take care of there employees and give them respect flexible, competitive, diverse, leadership, culture, community and social impacts work with amazing people, understand how to build and maintain real services. the benefits are amazing and relatively easy to move up if you do well. had fun!!! great people! great exercise! good pay for a temp job. everyone was very nice. miss them all. constant change and new ideas/projects to work on flexible schedule, great stocks options, amazing work environment. there is a lot of room to grow and develop. the pay is fair. coworkers are very smart. the products & services being developed are exciting. the customer really is king. smart people that work hard push you. the company moves fast, there are a lot of smart people, and have a lot to learn. besides, there are many challenges to face. great culture, great people, interesting problems, demanding work. lots of opportunities for learning. i don't work there anymore some friendly people work there. -no politics or bs in the hiring or job. no in-person interviews where you can be discriminated against if someone doesn't like how you look or your personality. amazon gives everyone a chance. you'd expect this would lead to working with a bunch of bad apples, but i've found the opposite. nice people people who do what needs to get done to earn honest pay.-yes it's physical work, but you know this going in. i think of it as a payed workout. if you can't handle four hours of moving boxes around, then you probably really do need this job. there's people in their 50's, 60's and even 70's here, men and women, who do this work.-you have a set schedule. you can plan the rest of your life around this. occasionally you may have to stay a little longer (up to an hour) but this is rare and they will let you know as soon as they know. again, you know this going in.-you don't have to take any work home with you. the minute your shift is over, you don't have to think about your work. no emails, phone calls or texts (unless you signed up to be alerted about opportunities to pick up an extra shift).-amazon is obviously a huge and forward looking company. they treat their employees fairly and offer good benefits plus you know they will be around for a while. plenty of overtime, staff is friendly and your am is usually helpful this is a pretty fun company and job,very good for job starter i) fast paceii) great brand recognitioniii) good pay if they don't resonate with you 100%, it's not a good fit for you.amazon is different from anywhere else i've worked. the autonomy i have and the ability to make an impact are a refreshing change from previous companies. but you have to be self-motivated and go after it. nothing will just come to you here. energetic workforce, non-bureaucratic, flexible but long hours, great pay level - stock grants! i think amazon is the best company you can work if you cannot enter google/facebook. and you would get promotion if you work very hard. good pay and colleagues, good pay 3 days off consecutively well pay and lots of benefits. a set 10 hr work schedule, you work four days out of the week. i love the overall culture of amzn and the opportunity to work with so many talented and intelligent people. the location also can't be beat...simply put, seattle is awesome! - i work on a great team, and the process for career advancement is cut and clear. excellent atmosphere to work in. phenomenal leadership and ability to risk in with new ideas. the pros about working at amazon, there is lots of growth opportunities. pay is quite high. be mindful though and do the math... most compensation is tied to tenure ...from signing bonuses, for rsus (restricted stock units), as well as yearly increases all are tied to a vesting schedule that is up to 4 years long on most occasions. we do this for two reasons... 1) retention is horrifically low at fulfillment centers so anything to incentivize tenure (we're not above bribery!). 2) the vast majority of amazon managers have very short tenures at amazon, so few make it through to the end of their vesting schedule and they therefor never realize their full compensation. so it's easy to offer a high rate of pay when one knows most managers will never realize their full compensation.the ego boost for working for such a respected brand is enticing. amazon is fully aware of this and will leverage it as needed.promotional opportunities exist if you are willing to relocate.you will work with some really bright folks who are driven and motivated. good starting pay. until you get injured. laptop will be given to u.. so u can complete your work whenever u like.. take care of employees very much excellent work culture. one of the best company to work for. fast growth, good management, good learning there can be a really fast career development. if you show aptitude and a willingness to work you can go far. environment is very fast-paced, so you learn at faster rateyou are surrounded by smart action-oriented peopleinteresting projects one of the most customer centric and innovative company to work. great and open culture which always motivates everyone to perform at their best potential.

amazon is one of the few companies which, in addition to developing effective production metrics and encouraging continuous process innovation, has created a way of quantifying associate engagement and satisfaction with their area manager. amazon values the happiness of its workers and is committed to the values of servant leadership. friendly staff, relaxed office environment; paid vacation and sick time. the generous discount was the best thing the company had to offer. decent start up pay for warehouse work working among your co workers insurance is good if you can afford it at the low

thought. for the industry there is great pay, strong benefits package, great co-workers, & visionary leadership.i'm given the opportunity the opportunity to take on new responsibility and grow consistently over the years. i've had the chance to travel, domestically and abroad, a dozen times.the company gets involved in the community, not as much as i would like to see, but they are good corporate citizens to our area.amazon is the truest meritocracy of which i've been a part. strong performance is rewarded, while poor performance is managed out or to a a better fitting role. there is always some favoritism in every organization, but i've seen the least amount here.my favorite thing about amazon is how it really follows it's mission of being the 'earth's most customer-centric company.\" like the bible or constitution, being 'customer-centric' can be interpreted differently by different people, but in my experience, a positive impact of customers, and then employees, is at the forefront of every decision. it is an amazing environment working at amazon. the team is great and friendly. there is a lot of team-work. many opportunities in different fields, all over the world meeting new associates, becoming an ambassador, going to other states to help train associates for the opening of a new building. peak season is the best when it comes to hrs. it becomes full time until peak season is over. it's like they say about new york city; you should live there while your young so you can experience all it has to offer, but don't stay too long because it will grind you into dust. the deliver-at-all-costs machine flings bodies left and right. there's a reason the average length of employment is 18 months.pros* some smart people to learn from* fast moving culture* opportunity to learn quite a few things as long as you don't linger too long educating yourself i really enjoyed working for u it inspired me what i can achieve ith met a lot of friends and i just want to say thank u for keeping me going good company to work for. highly motivated environment. smart people. good money but only if you do lot of overtimes. free coffee. great place to work. you have your freedom to choose any topic and work on your own project. wonderful extra curricular activities. fun team. like minded people. very less positiveness to talk about.forget about work life balance. there is no personal life once you join amazon. work environment is great apart from a good salary and compensations a good place to work if you are a dynamic and proactive person. initiative is highly apreciated. - hard problems to solve- great peers- great growth potential- startup like team culture with individual projects good paygood facilities in general, food may suck though. good payamazing studing opportunitiesgreat benefits innovativecompensationcompany advancementcompensation (twice) yesmoney is great but not everythingtraveling to various states for training the hours are flexible and it's generally a good second job to support with yourself with. great people great work environment. company does great things for employees on special days. great pay and benefits, freedom to experiment and change things, co-workers great pay for the work being done. i'm not sure if they're are really any positives to working for amazon. nice starting salary and bonus cheap outsourced non trained standardized tech level employees just like uber, which is also a horrible display of customer service good hours and great benefits great health benefits. i work with amazing people that want to do their best. great place to work - do great stuff in every field - technology, business, processes and leadership. amazing challenges, problems to solve and people to work with. amazon is a top notch group of people. best part is getting to use all the different aws technologies and being able to experiment. the stock is not bad, i guess. and you can say, i'm working at amazon. - they are doing good, cutting edge work in technology industry-leading scale. amazon builds and operates some of the largest computing systems in the world. 40 hour weeks, paid personal time, voluntary overtime offered at times, mandatory 60 hour weeks from black friday to december 23rd. not that i could find out as compared to any other tech giant i have worked for. every company has techies, so does this company have. perks are not that great benefits, pay (could be better though), perks (could be better though), for me the hours. benefits, good pay, work from home fast paced, smart individual contributors, insane growth. the work is pretty easy. it can also be fun since the inbound stations pair up two people so you can talk as long as you get your work done. you get to see really cool stuff that you never knew exsisted, everything from food to sex toys!the co-workers are helpful. you can lose weight walking 15+ miles a day.you can dress in casual comfy clothes. training coaches are really good. five years’ experience as data analyst in inventory and quality assurance.my skills include being able to solve routine inventory problems that may be more detailed or complex than normal including system analysis and reconciliation of inventory. there would be no problem with referring to an inventory control along with checking data for reconciliation challenging projects. fast paced work dynamics the best reasons to work at amazon.com is the pay, the teameork, and the benefits. pay rate is commensurate with area as are the benefits. you got to be trained in many departments. departments include: inbound receive, inbound stow (stock), inventory control quality assurance (counting inventory), picking (first step in the outbound process), crisplant (packing multiple items into one box), singles (packing each item into a box by itself), and loading trucks. you got to participate in a great exercise program (there's a lot of walking involved in working at amazon.com)! you would also be able to sign up to train new associates! you do get to work overtime if you choose. the benefit package is nice the money was great and the talent of my peers far exceeded any group i have worked with. vision/ltd/std, employees are given stock, generous time off, paid holidays great entry job. benefits. stocks. benefits are great and it is easily to move up in the company. the company created a very comfortable and relaxed work environment. everything is pretty straight forward and easy to do. there is also slot of overtime available. hours are good... pay is good. as long as you do your job, you won't have anyone constantly looking over your shoulder. it grows strong characteristics in life of individuals that are ready for self reliance work and mentality. good stock growth so far easy to get hired. lenient about time off when you need it. you can manage your own personal time. four day work week, so three days off is a plus. great training. very patient and detailed work-life balance is as good as it gets. - great benefits, including dental and vision, at a reasonable price.- plenty of opportunity for voluntary time off during the slower months.- literally anyone can get a job here. 4 days on and 3 days off, room to grow for the right person. good management team and flexible hours for those that are in college good ben, good co workers great benefits and good pay incredible benefits and schedule accommodation. break is provided each 2 and 1/2 hours. friendly staff. pay day is each 2 weeks, which it makes it easy to save money. benefits, competitive pay, advancement opportunities challenging, engaging work culture, good people the work week is 3 on four off and then 4 on 3 off. benefits start day one. some people are hard workers. the name looks good on your cv best culture and environment is here good brand for your cv clear promotion process and management is approachable for most issues. - you are surrounded by smart and talented people- you have so much to learn- free and open technology, you get to work on multiple technologies- fast paced culture good salary , cutting edge technology level headed people to work with becoming comfortable/thriving in ambiguity; you will learn new definitions for customer obsession and frugality amazon is an amazing company - i haven't seen anything like it. it's a place where you're encouraged to \"think big\" while still having to focus on the details and deliver results. there are truly incredible people working here, and it's easy to reach across the organization and benefit from their knowledge. this is a company where displays of true ownership are rewarded. if you see a problem or an opportunity, don't wait for someone else to give you permission to look at it - go and see! sure, you shouldn't go off for two weeks working on something new without telling anyone, but management is open to hearing about ideas about what needs to be done.the vancouver office is a \"remote\" office in that it's a few hours away from the corporate hq in seattle, but the culture here is very much amazonian. the leadership principles are consistent across the company (although occasionally open to interpretation), and as we continue to grow the office feels more and more like a \"1st class\" amazon office every day.amazon has had a bad reputation about operational load, but i can only speak to my own experience - the load is minimal. it is very rare that someone on my team gets paged because of an issue, and almost always that takes place during business time. having the team handle operations, instead of sourcing it out to a dedicated support team, instills a strong quality ethic in the team and as a result the software is of much higher quality. amazon india provides very good environment to work. challenging work, exciting opportunities, and career mobility get to work very closely with high level management, pretty flexible schedule, variety of grown opportunities i love spending my days with smart and funny people. i love being a part of exciting innovation and design. i feel highly respected and a vital part of the success of the business. culturally, there are plenty of fun opportunities from guest speakers to musicians to art classes. if you want more hours or pick up days always available 1. i see many people saying amazon uses employees in crazy ways. that's not true at least to me or to any one i know. it really depends on the individual employees to maintain the work-life balance. in my org, no one is forced to work a minimum of certain number of hours. you control your own pace as long as you deliver on time. i probably work overtime (> 8 hours/day) once every few months. i was still able to be promoted to next level in less than two years.2. management is really a hit or miss. and this is true to all the companies i believe. when you have a healthy management chain up to vp level as i do, your manager, skip level manager care about you as an individual contributor.3. minimum politics you have to hear about. at least among the sdes i know, there's no politics in their work.4. you are the owner. instead of having multiple people owning same project like what i've experienced in other tech companies, at amazon you are the owner of your project. you get all the credits for the good things you've done and no one can take it away from you. you own the coes when you make mistakes, learn and grow from your mistake is a very healthy way to your growth (and promotion).5. trust me, as long as you are capable, amazon is the place for you to shine. if you are not that solid on your skills, learn in the hard way. you will be very capable and confident even if you decide to try other career opportunities.amazon is not a good fit for you if you are not capable, not curious on learning. you will feel there's no work-life balance since you cannot deliver. easy work. no experience required. pay weekly, flexible hours, growth opportunities i love the flexibility of working hours and location, as well as the level of top leadership engagement on my program, as well as big ideas that can come from anywhere in the company. the innovation here is astounding. the facilities (buildings, kitchens, quiet spaces, mother's rooms...) are world class and safety oriented.i have worked in the customer service (cs) and finance teams as well as a \"pilot\" group in the retail organization. working in the cs and finance teams was a great experience with strong leadership that cares about its people and teams that work together to accomplish great things.there are tons of opportunities to learn and to contribute to changing the way the world does things. working in fulfillment center is straightforward. tasks are repetitive but meeting performance standards isn't difficult. very flexible time off benefits. 401k match (but a limited amount), stock incentives, multiple healthcare packages, personal leave options, and the impression amazon makes on a resume can't be denied. seemingly better pay. stocks (but you may not stay here for 4 years to reap the benefits). smart people. pay was good. 12/hr. only 4 workdays 10 hour days. still quite fun since it allows teams to run more independently with clear ownership and reasonable autonomy. - other developers on my team are really smart- other developers on team to socialize and commiserate about how awful it is- working for a company that tries to treat its customers well - good compensation- great technology- start up mentality- fast pace- detail oriented- multinational corporation with global reach if you like your work time spent in actually 'doing' your job and not divide it between attending various planning meetings, then this is a place to be. lots of very smart people, stock's high. as a new grad, you will learn a lot of things very quickly. engineering decisions are bottom up, not foisted upon from top managment, you get to choose what you think are projects that make for a better customer experience, and also make your life easier. the people who one works with make all the difference, the people here are bright, and friendly. the customer obsession thing is not a lie, which is somewhat refreshing after money grubbung at other firms. very dynamic work environment, always something new to do. we do some amazing stuff and the release cycles are quick. provides opportunity to work with very smart people. best part is to be able to move around within the company and work at other groups. since the company has a lot of diverse functions - retail, aws etc, you don't have to be stuck with the same group for many years. good work culture and lots of perks working climate is nice, peers have a great sense of teamwork good people, good environment, good work life balance, modern work culture a lot of growthgreat learning experienceexcellent working environment flexible working time and dress code good work at company. good progress amazon as brand adds value to your resume best work place and have lot of benefits!great fun! very much happy n blessed to work with a great organizationlots of learning opportunities.best facility and office space. good personal experience as they teach you everthing from the get go and make it easier. - growth possibilities- great exit options- global movement flawless- mistakes are treated as learnings shift flies by and there is overtime. ownership over your own work with little micro managing 3 days off a week, benefits, paid holidays, everything's new. management is a good assortment of knowledge and personalities, always approachable. good pay and benefits. good work environment. great

weekly every friday and the pay is just. - when they say customer centric they mean it. most companies talk about the customer, but in the end its about how much you can make out of them. amazon is a business but it believes so much in passing the savings to the customer. every single senior leader cares deeply about any customer impacting issue. its inspiring.- the best shine and get rewarded. you perform, you'll get attention, compensation, opportunities, you name it. they reward people who over-achieve.- little politics. for a company this size, i'm amazed at how much a team environment it is. i would have expected different from a large corporate american company. its not like that and you actually have to talk to your issues in front of your svp.- amazing people. amazon is doing some ground-breaking stuff so naturally they have a lot of amazing people, but not just technically gifted. at amazon, the soft skills are just as important as tech. so you get to work with people who you admire and look forward to working with every day. its a team- technology. amazon is leading the way in cloud-computing and across the rest of the company there are other really cool things happening. they have the scale only a handful of companies do. its stuff you just don't get to see in other companies- challenge. i doubt there is a company doing anything like amazon is doing at the pace and scale they have. every single day i get challenged. its pretty amazing to go to a job every day thats not only interesting but helps continually grow you stress free environment with an amazing guidance made me one of the good performer in this company. express our talent and stand high on the floor! get to do some pretty cool work. good pay. exposure to complete tech stack

benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. no dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome. the pay isn't so bad. and the benefits are pretty good as well. co workers are the only thing that kept me there. for the most part, you are in control of what you are doing. you don't get micromanaged a lot. at the end of the day you will be able to see if you won or lost based on how you ran the shift and what variables you had to deal with. there is not a lot of bureaucracy or red tape and things move very quickly. the day also goes by very fast. you walk out the door at the end of the day knowing exactly what you accomplished.salary is pretty good. opportunities for advancement do exist and it doesn't take forever to have a chance at moving up. lots of other opportunities for lateral movement in between different departments. also lots of opportunity to move around the country if you like to relocate. you get to learn a lot very quickly. they encourage movement from one job to the next.interacting with the associates can be challenging but you can develop some good relationships and help them succeed. the problem though is that there is very little room for them to move upward and most of them realize it so it can be a challenge to motivate them.there are lots of weeks where you get 3 days off. most area managers work weds to sat or sun to weds outside of peak. unless mandatory ot is called for the associates you will usually get 3 days off which helps you recover from the intensity of the work week. it has good salary. and the environment is good. flexible work hours, wide access to resources, fast moving, intelligent coworkers, casual dress attire, very efficient, not may bureaucratic obstacles technology, company

benefits. depending on your organization, the work culture could be stress free. peers are technically excellent and the hiring committee makes sure of that. amazon is stoked with bright people, a reasonably fast pace, ever growing and expanding business, and a vibrant startup culture. over the years, a lot of rough edges have been smoothed, and if you're on the right team (there are many great teams), it is a great career experience. the fact that amazon obsesses over customers tends to filter out the ego maniac managers and rude people (if they can get hired by amazon on other merits). over time, those folks don't survive, because they end up doing things that negatively impact customers. amazon has added extra opportunities for guest lecturers on a variety of deep technical and scientific topics. financial strength of the company. salary is good and benefits are unbelievable very good company with no work pressure. you can enjoy doing job here. fast-paced with some of the

amazon pays well. really well. with the addition of stock as part of the total compensation package, it's the gift that keeps on giving. it's also really nice that they pay my bus fare and allow me to bring my dog to work every day.a lot of companies are trying to emulate the atmosphere of working at amazon by letting employees play games, drink beer, and wear their pajamas to work. that's all cool, but it misses the mark. the amazon culture is based around the 14 leadership principles. every employee embraces the lps and works hard to exhibit them in everything they do. they really are the heart and soul of the company. decently flexible scheduling and training is good great place to work and culture english speaking colleagues, ownership, smart people there is a high bar so you're

working at due to the fact that i enjoy working more then 8 hours, i liked my job and the employees, there are two shifts: morning and evening, so you can pick according to your flexibility! opportunities to get what you want out of your career. looks great on your resume, conversation topic for future interviews. great for people just starting out on their careers very easy work to do good pay great benefits , cool chances to win prizes that's about t perksgrowthbrandovertimeonlineeasy workmanagers are nice and are patient with employees the amazon fulfillment center provides a fun fast pace work environment. many schedule options and the way they allow you to manage your time off is pretty cool as well. it's relatively easy to get a job here. it's a pretty fast paced place to work. you are given the ability to take time off almost immediately. opportunities to improve on processes, night shift, 4 days. at fresh, its pretty small, so there are opportunities for advancement for full-timers. working with extremely smart people easy to get in, fair salary aws gives its engineers a tremendous amount of responsibility and empowers them to do whatever it takes to meet customer needs. as a senior software development engineer you are responsible for requirements analysis, architecture design, software design, project management, software implemention, testing and operations for teams of 4 - 20 engineers. the services you are responsible for could have thousands to hundreds of thousands of customers and involve internet scale parallel computing problems. many people complain about the work environment being too fast paced and quality oriented, but what did everyone expect? this company uses one of the most advanced and efficient distribution systems in the world. to be a part of such an intricate system requires knowledge and an ability to produce results that won't clog up the efficiency of the system. the work is hard, detail-oriented, and at times tedious but a job here is also tremendous fun if you can get lost in your work. it's also a genuine opportunity. less nimble minds fail to see in the long term and look only at the short-term monotony. a job you respect at this company can easily turn into a career. the pay was decent at best lots of great projects. lots of relocation options. good benefits. stocks are going well. very good benefits. team is very helping and supportive. very good learning experience. one will try hands on new technology and adapt to learning fast ok pay, 28k for a first job.very fun and intelligent

are great. you really have to earn your promotions and they are more merit based than anywhere else i've come across. wage.quick promotion possibility is possible but not for certain. ability to create own schedule as a reserves team member.bonuses and prizes available for meeting and exceeding goals was brought on as a seasonal with promises of being hired on.was let go on the day i was supposed to be brought on along with 25 other people. benefits are terrific, especially health insurance. i am given the opportunity to work closely with our ambassadors, mentor and train them to function at their best. i am the team lead and i enjoy helping my team. benefits, fun co workers to work with. good place to work and grow wonderful place great opportunities love it here its a great place to work - great pay- great benefits- promotes from within- love the idea of upper management open to associates input about improving processes within the department and implementing them. during my time there i have improved processes in various departments.- encountered some great minds in upper management that was very encouraging, fair and always pushed for the best from me.- there is never a boring moment working at amazon.- i believe they have an amazing principle system that most companies do not instill or encourage from their workers.- they have various programs that benefits you even if it does not benefit them. you get benefits day one. great benefits, great opportunity. simple, works with schedule, friendly excellent hard working, considerate happy cant think of any other than that they are located in downtown but dont provide any transport for non employees or meal benefits like other engineers. tedious and mindless work if that is what you are looking for. amazon is an incredible place to work, filled with amazingly talented people. it is a place where new technology meets the salt of the earth work that happens in the fulfillment centers that drives the heart of the business. this unique situation is held together by core principles that permeate all levels of the company, from the top, to the bottom.when you work here, you will have the opportunity to take on as many challenges as you're willing to. there are few companies, tech, or otherwise, that will allow you to have almost free reign on their systems, processes, and standards. if you have the time, in addition to the work you are mandated, you have the ability to tackle any number of increasingly complex and mind-boggling challenging puzzles to solve. these take many forms, and can be incredibly rewarding, giving you experience in areas you never thought you would have. if you are someone who doesn't need direction, is self-starting and can get things done, quickly, there is limitless ability to challenge yourself at amazon.some teams are situated to take off, and if you get on the right one, at the right time, and have the necessary skillset, your life will suddenly feel like it's moving quicker than it used to. time will pass instantly, and weeks turn to months before you realize what is happening. it's an incredible experience when this happens. both in the field, and at corporate, this type of feeling is pervasive.plan to be stretched regardless of the role you're in. amazon is designed in such a way that the tasks that are given to you are almost too much for you to accomplish. you will need to be creative, take on partners, design new processes, and manage your time better than you thought humanly possible before coming on. you are in charge of your own work-life balance in the sense that you must know when to say 'slow down', or risk taking on too much and miss deliverables, this is frowned upon. many of the reviews here fail to mention the employee responsibility in understanding their own workload, and being firm enough to push-back when it's exceeded their capacity. most managers will understand this, and help you manage your workload if it exceeds what they think you can hit. that doesn't mean you won't have a tremendous amount to do, it means you need to know when to say enough or re-prioritize what it is you are working on. there is a tendency to take on too much, and burn out, you must insulate yourself from that process.there's a huge demand here for the ability to get things done quickly and efficiently. amazon has not fostered an academic work environment. you will need to work with the information you have, or can quickly dig up, and make incredibly powerful and critical decisions with what would otherwise be considered ambiguous information. this is where it gets tricky, the principles of 'are right a lot' could be replaced with the more common having 'good instincts'. having good instincts is a mixture of both learning while at the company, and your skills when you come in. if you don't have good instincts, or don't trust your own judgement, you will have a very hard time at amazon. that being said, you also have to be right, very often - or rapidly learn from your mistakes and improve. this fast, iterative, learning, is part of what makes amazon difficult to work at, but also why employees who can hang on for some time are highly regarded and needed to keep on to keep the business from repeating prior mistakes. + great ownership and sense of responsibility and impact, you will work on and launch technical or business initiatives quickly and often.+ excellent development culture and tools and architecture around work and getting work done+ supportive team+ most

and then they offer voluntary time off for days they don't have enough work but it's maybe 15% of the time over one year. a board to write your concerns down if you feel that your opinion would actually make a difference (personally i don't). quick job when you need one.set schedule ( can be more depending on workload).multiple paid breaks throughout shift. great pay. one month of training

growth.-learning path.- beautiful office. you get free gloves and a vest, kidding aside, this is character building work great company, excellent place for demonstrating ownership and innovation. lot of learning opportunities and internal portability. always around smartest people colleagues are incredibly smart and driven. this helps you to grow and improve your own abilities, however the downside is an incredibly cutthroat environment. there are so many opportunities!!! very customer oriented with always pursuing new ways to be more efficient with frugality. bottom line is money. the company handcuffs managers with bonuses that vest every six months. 1. incredibly smart, driven and dedicated teams;2. scope and responsibility like no where else you'll work;3. likelihood of having one or more \"jeff\" meetings is fairly high depending upon the team you join, which is mind-blowing the first time (then it's a slog);4. leadership principles are practiced across all aspects of the business (hiring, meetings, talent management), which is more than i can say for other companies that hand-wave at similar tenets once or twice a year during reviews. challenging opportunity but you have the opportunity to really meet customer expectations. the organization is very focused on the making the customer and their associates happy. let us start with amazon first and then with aws. amazon has this unique method of hiring. when there is a fire at amazon and a dire need to hire, you will be immediately called for interviews and the whole interview process is expedited within weeks and you will also get an offer the next day you are interviewed. after applying for 4 years consistently i got my first call and then got called onsite right away and then an offer within 24 hours. i understood they needed a person on board very badly. because it is amazon, you will take the offer right away without thinking and plus the offer is so lucrative that you will just take it. don’t be fooled with the stock options they offer as a part of the hiring package. ask for more base salary or joining bonus. average tenure at amazon for an employee is 1.5 years and stock options mature in 3rd and 4th year and hence you don’t see a single penny of it. amazon pays you high but takes away your personal and family life. it is a place where everyone tries to prove they are right, even at the cost of other colleagues. so it is a rat race, where everyone tries to outsmart other at any cost. in the end people are very exhausted and look for other options. the office politics gets to you if you believe that hard work is the only means to progress in your career. not many people know that amazon has this unique culture of laying off 10% of the work force every year irrespective of what you put in. so your relationship with your manager and other managers also will matter when it comes to review. also, at amazon, anyone can write a review about you at any time, which will count towards your final performance review. so you have to watch your back constantly and have to be people smart and also work smart. this is not easy because even if you put in 120% you may not be in the best books with others because you did company’s good and in doing so, you stepped over someone in some way, who will write a review about you and to which you have no visibility to. so what you will see in your review will always be a surprise. if a decision is made to let you go per the 10% lay off rule, then they will give you 100 excuses and reasons of not performing. except if you join in the last 3 months of the year, you are in for a review. i joined in september and in 15th week of my service, i was told that i am a part of the performance improvement program, which is a sophisticated name for the 10% people, who are walked off on any day the manager wants. the guard comes with a box and takes your tag and computer and you walk with an embarrassment. the culture is so rough that you hardly make any good friends at work because everyone is constantly thinking you are being nice but not sure if you will write a decent review. nice place to work..very competitive environment...gives a tough competition for growth..enterpreneurial, smart people...good brand...good learning curve the pay and benefits were nice, and the job itself provided a nice way to stay

hiring process, community service, workplace atmosphere autonomy, experience really depends on the team great benefits and opportunities for growth 3 days off a week focus on customers rather than on stockholders is a huge plus. instead of being profit driven, which can lead to cost cutting and lower quality products, amazon focuses on delivering products that provide the best customer experience.my experience has been five stars, because i am in a job position best suited to my abilities, i am on a really great team with highly capable individuals, and my direct manager provides

weekly poa talks, and learning series that will help you improve your knowledge and know what other teams are doing.- working here looks good on your resume. although slowly declining, working at amazon is still a big deal, sort of!- pet friendly, urban campus.- access to world class principal engineers. training and lots of opportunity for growth, long hours but decent rewards for performers. a great place to hone ones skills. health care package is great and pay is, as long as you aren't in the it field. benefits are great and people you meet are pretty cool not much - work long hard hours and you're viewed as a number, a disposable robot. medical, dental, vision coverage and working some with unique amazing people. you'll learn a lot and its a growing environment. i used to get really frustrated about the focus on frugality and the not-invented-here and build-it-over-buy-it mentality there. however, seeing how the rest of the work does it, i'm good with the frugal approach and building it and doing work. most people out there do it via spending money on products to expand the domain of the it manager, without any focus on the business, and without any metrics for success -- amazon is the opposite fo that. everything needs a cost justification and its difficult to build empires without any competency.the topgrading environment is actually good in some ways because it does eliminate a lot of the people that you have to put up with at other jobs who are totally useless. the bar raising interviews and stack ranking does actually mean that you might be working with a bunch of other decently talented people rather than trying to drag a department along single handed.i usually get bored at a company after 2-3 years, but i stuck with amazon for nearly 5 years before getting bored with it because it was growing so fast (grew from managing 400 servers to 30,000 servers in 5 years). at some point, though, i'd learned most of the lessons dealing with scale, and that exposed the fact that i simply didn't like working for the company or the upper management (bezos in particular). entrepreneurial opportunities within company, the ceo and some of the svps are the very best, no red tape, smart people, stock, brand. casual attire allowed everyday of the week good career growth with exposure to a high-success way of doing business. great to focus on the customer rather than on stock share prices. very strong it engineering, lots of extremely smart people, plenty to learn, interesting tech challenges. minimal formalism, engineers often have direct contacts with their business customers. generally, there is very little balance, practically everybody i've met in different parts of organization were true professionals. growth and money you can grow really fast work with empowered, very smart people. lots of interesting technology. individual groups have a lot of autonomy and are empowered to make their own decisions. got to work on a cool project that the whole world can see. would have been a great career opportunity for advancement, however we are all aware of the great crash of 2008 and the impact this is having on consumers. hence this is a tough year to be in retail and a time when most management are fearful of making investments. however, this could also be a time of great opportunity for visionary leaders who are willing and able to invest with an eye on the future. how will american consumers buy post this crash, online of course! hence amazon needs to position herself to lead in this future. in fact, feel responsible for driving, creating and innovating to bring this future to past. other positives, great location, awesome discount on website products and opportunity to learn about retailing the company hires really smart people and create a great product that really focuses on the end user. lots of hours, 4 day work week (unless you have to work overtime) good benefits i worked 40 hours a week until peek hit. then my hours were up to 55 a week. managers that listen, plenty of o.t. freindly place to work, job requirements are easy to learn, fast paced environment, help from other workers is readily available it looks really good on a resume. people always ask about it. safety walks, gemba. it is great if you are young and with out a family. i worked in the biz dev side of the aws partner team for 2.5 years and loved it. the pace of innovation at aws is mind blowing. the products and services that the team works with are market leading and the opportunity before aws is staggering. i thoroughly enjoyed my 2.5 years there and would have happily stayed for me. i was scooped up by an aws partner to lead an even bigger opportunity.i'd highly recommend time at aws! great company to work for if you're tech oriented. the interview process was a bit thorough, but necessary, the pay was solid and i moved up within 6 months. overall a positive employment experience. oh my god, this job is the best kept secret, now mind you i had to drive a little ways to get to the job site because i live in milwaukee, and the job is in kenosha, but its well worth it, the pay is great and the energy is so high, you get to wear jeans, a t shirt and tennis shoes, there's a lot of walking so you get a full work out, so if you like to stay in shape, this is the place, you get paid every friday, my dream, and you get a discount on every product known to man kind, and the people are so down to earth, their friendly, and very helpful, so i give amazon two thumbs up, this is definetly my kind of place to work! decent hours for part time. pay is pretty good for the work. not slave labor, nor are you treated like a slave. very lenient on many things. this is a work from home position. fast paced and high volume call activity. there is ample opportunity for overtime. good benefits and good pay high motivation employees, very good control over development process even from sde1 role, fast development cycle for a large company. i enjoyed working in a fast paced, loud, gigantic space. i enjoyed working in groups as a team. i enjoyed how we had team meeting every morning to help motivate and encourage us to reach our goals. it give you the opportunity lo develop a lot of problem solve skills and experience with the vendors and vendor support. concerned about employee welfare, great hours, work from home. i interned at amazon for 12 weeks and found the work culture awesome. many people are willing to help you. a lot to learn. good benefits and projected company growth ok starting salaryideas for improvement encouragedindividuals can really impact operations work from home. company is awesome. great employers. most fun i've ever had! you have a lot of

dynamic and passion they have towards work is awesome and put their max to achieve the goals. best company i have worked. gud compensation all good i really enjoyed working at amazon . * vibrant work culture - you work hard and have fin* cab facility - extremely well maintained transport system* pay for over time* good job training. stock price are high.reimburse your mobile bill.reimburse your commute cost. (or parking)health insurance paid.less or almost no accountability on your responsibility technical leader in cloud industry, not bad pay, growing fast, working location flexibility, plenty training, capable colleagues, growing fast in china it's a well-respected company, and a lot of exciting things are happening. i think the company has a good long-term outlook the company provides a lot of opportunities to work on various projects and interact with different groups. in addition, it is fairly easy to move around to different groups. the results of your projects are very visible and you will have the opportunity to interact with management. the company has a very long-term approach and seems to be well positioned for the future. scale -- amazing opportunity to have exposure to large-scale ecommerce, website, infrastructure. truly the most top-notch security folks i have seen anywhere.solid company -- i believe that amazon has a good, solid core business and that jeff truly does have vision.amazing colleagues -- some really smart, good people that i have loved to work with. exceedingly competent software development overall.vacation -- stay there long enough (7+ years) and you'll get a decent amount of vacation. good, long term vision that seems to be paying off. there is no micromanaging on my team, and i'm free to make whatever corrections i deem are necessary. if i see a problem and decide it needs fixing there is nothing in my way, and i enjoy this freedom. the people you will be working with are amazingly clever. the \"bar raising\" approach they bring to interviews really has done a lot to keep the employee base competent.you will be building software used my hundreds of thousands of people. good compensation package, no state tax in washington. competitive with google and microsoft.a lot of exciting teams to work on, which was surprising, especially to those that view amazon as a \"bookstore.\"teams are usually small, divided into two pizza teams, meaning that each team can be fed by two pizza. this is nice. philosophy of focusing on the customer and they truly mean it. many times we made decisions that were bad for the company short-term but better for the customer. great to be guided by what's good for the customer.strong sense of innovation - they try to do things in a new way and think big and ambitiously. you will have the opportunity to build interesting products and features.stability - jeff bezos has a very long time-horizon and runs the company for the long term. although the stock has traditionally gone up and down, the overall investment strategy is actually conservative. this company is unlikely to have anything that's a big hit that causes the stock to shoot through the roof, but you can count on fairly steady growth and i would not be surprised if the company is never forced to go through significant downsizing again.size - the company is actually quite small. don't be fooled by employee headcount numbers, most of those people are working in distribution centers and customer support. the actual meat of the company, the people building things, is small and fits in a couple buildings in seattle. the product management leadership is a small group and it is easy to make an impact. the money. they pay you a lot to work a hell of a lot. no work / life balance so kiss that goodbye. the benefits are okay, but honestly, this is probably something you won't even have time to enjoy depending on which department you work for. if you are an it professional, run don't walk away from this company. they work their it employees extra hard and not much appreciation is awarded. other than that, there are small perks by working for amazon. visiting book authors will stop by and employees get a chance to meet them and hear them talk in a conference room. that's about it! genuinely intelligent co-workers. i have always been very impressed by the quality of the people i work with at amazon. loved my team and managers. hq was sweet. innovative and some of the smartest people you'll work with. you get to be apart of growing something cool. great benefits, great money, great company consistent pay, consistent job activities, schedule and expectations working with some good people; plenty of overtime during peak season; casual dress. working from home is probably the only real benefit of this position. on any other day i would have passed this job along. job is pretty simple, lots of room for advancement, 4 days on 3 days off company stock has had very strong and consistent growth. a large portion of your income will come from stocks, but this is a good thing given the growth. lots of opportunities too grow working here will defiantly make you a stronger person then you were before you started at amazon . the overtime during peak is hard work but the time and a half pays out well with 60hr weeks. if you can stick it out and not give up here it will make any other job a peice of cake! great benefitsleave when you want todecent pay employee centric company which give best to their people. great work life balance. 1.you will have a steep learning curve with something new always around the corner.2. you will get to work with some very smart people.3. decent salaries. good culture fast pace working environment. best place to learn things rate of pay, paid break,

are straight out of high school. - great pay for entree level job- quick and easy training period- supplies consistent work with plenty to do- various job positions and rotation cycles they willingly hire people with little to no experience, thus affording applicants a chance to work. pace, challenges, learning - one has to deliver work at a rapid pace. fail fast is a mantra here and there is no space for slackers! great benefits! it's easy to move up as long as you work hard and make an impression. you are also given a portion of the companies assets. discounts down hurt either. pay you a nice salary everything about the company is good great people to work with high potential, high energy teams with a lot of innovative startups working within an ecosystem of a large scale ecommerce company. where, what and how you want to grow is all up to you (after you finish a year, and prove your mettle).you could choose to be within a startup business or a scaling business and still have a lot of learning opportunities.however, don't expect to be served responsibilities in a platter - even if you're an ivy league alum.if you're a type a - this is the place for youif you're a detail oriented person - be hereif you like a low key job, that hums along - i don't know of anyone with such a job within amazon. great company - very tough hiring process, once you get through be prepared for personal and professional growth at an aggressive pace! the work is pretty hard we receive pto, upt and vacation superior compensation, smartest people in the industry work there, lightning fast advancement opportunities the usage of pto and upt is flexible. it was the only company that would hire a university grad with no social network to mooch off of, and no previous work experience. however they also hire any kid fresh out of high school. great pay, benefits, and people fun and innovative work environment. leadership principles are the basis to this company that is always evolving. jump on board or be passed up. fast moving, growing, innovative company full of smart people. if you are self-motivated and want to get things done, this is your place. never a dull moment

services they add new writers. they don't just throw the new work on our existing writers' plates.- a strong editorial support staff - a really good ratio between writers and editors ensures that the technically oriented writers produce good text.- an active tools team - they are always working to automate more of the process and improve our tooling to allow us to focus on what really matters:

be bored. once you are in the middle to higher levels within the company the amount of movement and the variety of projects to undertake are enough to always keep your mind interested.growth has been essential while working at amazon. as the company has grown so has most of it's staff with it. the opportunities for promotion and movement between teams are numerous. i have seen individuals move quickly up the organization or laterally until they have found the job that was right for them.additionally the compensation is competitive with most other employers in it's class. knowing that you

attend and even contribute to a number of decisive meetings with the team. good pay for entry level position, amazing benefits that begin on hire date. holiday time and pay included. i have heard from many people that the culture here at aws is reminiscent of my former employer from 2010 (ie. 5 years ago). work-life balance is great. expectations are reasonable. pay is above industry average for experience and position. i don't feel overworked or stressed. this comes down to the way we set expectations with our customers.i used to get phone call after phone call (about 10 per day on higher volume days) at my last employer and there was a large emphasis on us answering the phones because there was no automation system (it was part of their support ideals that you don't get menus or automated responses). here, we can tidy up the last project we were working on before taking on a new case, which lowers stress levels and lets us focus on the customer's case to the best of our ability so that we have less going on in our minds.meetings are not excessive and are very pointed (the floor meeting is once per week for about 30 minutes and has a clear agenda with relevant information for the engineers).team events/outings and general cohesiveness is abundant. knowledge sharing is fantastic. i feel like i'm truly making a difference when i walk in the door. oh yeah, flexible work environment: if i want to work from home, i can. if i want to work in the office, i can. if i want to fly home to visit family (or go to a reunion), i can do so and not take time off when i work remotely. * get to work with pretty amazing people* decent salary the days off, good benefits good pay, 4 day work week, fast pace! they give you the ability to work in your own space and

have a fuller perspective to write this. after a year in, i have to say i enjoy working here as much as i did the day i started. amazon is a unique place to work. after having worked at so many tech companies that are run like dictatorships, it's nice to be somewhere where everyone's input is not only listened to, but encouraged. amazon has an amazing hiring bar and because of this they expect everyone to be contributing to advancing their product. the high hiring bar also means that you will always work with amazingly smart people. you'll never have to pick up the slack for a team mate who just doesn't get it. everyone is skilled and driven. managers work constantly with their team to focus on career goals. you let your manager know where you want to be in 1/3/5 years and a clear path is written up on how to get there. then focus is given to make sure tasks are made available to you to get there, or you find those tasks yourself and take some \"bias for action\" and just do them.

of growth market opportunityabove market wagesinspire peersplenty of demandinnovation on steroids fellow employees, within the same (or similar) classifications are generally always receptive to other employess needs, when given the time to do so. most employees have a knack for proactive customer service and tend to always go above and beyond the normalized 'customer centric' nature of customer service roles as can easily be witnessed within other industry classes of this nature. that is, they treat the customer's with a positive decorum that the customer is always right, even when they don't appear at all to be rightfully so. employees here, for the most part, strive to do the 'right' thing, rather and do what is calculated as the 'right thing' by a complex matrixing system designed to give the 'right answers/responses' to customer's complaints/concerns. they have great benefits. even for part time employees. including 500 dollar bonus after 3 months, 24/7 medical consultation and more! great company to work at amazon was a great place to grow a new career, and there was a lot of opportunity for me to try new things. when i found a good team and stayed there for a few years, it was very rewarding, and i was able to track the results of my team to the performance of my overall organization and the company. i think that is rare in tech. i stayed for more than 10 years because the culture was results-driven and it (at least theoretically) rewarded experiments and risk taking. ability to work from home. health/dental/vision benefits okay. more power to resolve customer issues than other customer service jobs. most immediate management ok. none, its a horrible place to work. development team is great, nice, friendly, helpful. access to all environments, very automated nearly stress free deployments. you are constantly learning new things every day.. every day is different.. motivates me to do better good tips, nice drivers, lots of overtime available + great culture for growth and development if you take charge and do it yourself.+ good healthcare benefits+ plenty of room to move into a new career and/or a new location w/ amazon+ decent time off policy the job offers a high salary for managers. i worked 4 days a week, 10 hours a day, and was making $12.50hr working overnight. my coworkers in my area (sorting) were some of the nicest people i've ever meet. also the holiday pay was great, for managers, the compensation is good compared to other companies/positions benefits, all be it, pretty crappy ones, but they are available. highest promotion velocity for any job you can find with out a degree flexible set schedule (schedule is set but there are 4 different shifts to choose from), health benefits are okay but i've seen better. the benefits are very good. low cost medical and you get it right when you start. there's also a good amount of time off given when you first start, which you'll need. you'll meet some good employees that you'll get close to because you work such long shifts. benefitswork with groups of very diverse co-workersa couple of free drinks from the machines smartest people who will push you to bring your

learn something new everyday. nice pay , ok benefits , flexible hours good health insurance and benefits i get to work from home and it's pretty relaxing! we get to chat all day with teammates and joke around with our supervisors since you're in a chat room with them. i've formed a bond with everyone on my team including my supervisor. you get hired on for 6 months around the holidays and they decide if they wanna keep you after that. so it's nerve racking towards the end. but you get benefits even as a temp employee. they also offer flex hours for anyone available. there are some cons i listed below but it's the same as every call center job ever so it's not like amazon is unique in the cons i'm going to list flexible times/ schedule, easy work good pay, fast growing company. good benefits including, cheap health insurance, 401k plan, unpaid and paid time off from day one, stock, after one year a tuition program is offered where they pay 95% for up to 4 years, $3000 a year.

we set records and became one of the best facilities in the amazon network, and for that i'm proud to be a part of the history there. they have a great benefits package and will help you pay your college tuition through the amazon careers program. the pay was good for the first year or so then it dropped as more employees came in, which i can understand but that raised an issue (see con #2). they put ps4's in the break rooms! referring to the logistic facilities. the pay and a great job if you're lazy or lack standards. you literally have to only show up. a lot of women. the industrial

is incredibly stimulating and rewarding.senior management and company tenants impressively insist on highest standards, and customer obsession is a real and seriously held litmus test for all

pretty sure there may be more of them in the future. however, the personal and professional lessons learned within those times are invaluable, and i am incredibly thankful for them.the philosophy of amazon is incredibly energizing. i cannot think of another company that is innovating at the scope and scale that amazon is. it is thrilling and a sincere honor to be able to make history, to feel

the companyinternational environment free, easy, no overtime, good managers good bonuses, equivalent to effort i have been working as a part of this company for more than 6 years and i had always had a learning curve. there is a lot of exposure and learning here. we will be working independently and no micro management is done. this is a opportunity to explore any domain any time.being a mom i am able to manage between work and family efficiently. because of the name and fame of amazon everything about amazon is a pro amazon culture and principles are the most best reason to work here. good work culturegood salarygood leave policy - innovative, not boring- laid back- encouraging leadership- travel opportunities nice canteen, pool table, growth opportunity great management,ability to relocate to multiple locations lots of social stuff.understanding how amazon works and learn new things each day.talk to different people each day.everyone gets projects. cool company and awesome people love the culture - they value experimentation, learning, and open dialogue. my work never gets boring, there's always challenges to tackle and new projects to dive deep on. they focus on writing over presentations which helps make sure that great ideas don't hinge on your ability to be a persuasive speaker. my favorite part of working at amazon is that the opportunities here are endless. you never feel like you are stuck in your current role. there are always opportunities to try and learn new things that are both directly and indirectly related to your current role. the other thing that i love is the\"flat\" culture that we have. no matter where you are in the hierarchy, you are not only encouraged, but expected to take ownership over projects and your ideas. this really has given me the ability to see the direct results of my work and pushing me to challenge myself in ways that i never would have otherwise.*the opinions expressed in this post are my own. i joined directly from the university as an sde i. amazon maintains really high bar for all the things they do. i got thrown into those pool of people and you eventually become like that.-no micro management-flexibly work hours-can take vacation any time (at least in my team)-can move to other internal teams very easily. plenty of oportunities there.- work on some rare problems that no other company in the world is working on. high ownership focus, you can drive your business with freedom, have the ability to fail and learn from mistakes, always expected to learn. - worked on real systems that are deployed in production today- learned a lot about code quality, patterns, and designs used in industry i liked the pace and the job. free coffee machine in cafeteria area was a plus. flex hours, work from home, equipment provided. benefits, paid time off, bonuses pay was goodgreat benefits the challenge and innovation at amazon is virtually endless. they truly do listen to your ideas and are willing to try things to improve processes, procedures, etc. they let you make your own schedule decent benefits, various different shifts codes that work different days of the week training is availble in whatever you might be interested ingetting an insight into company goals and standardsgenerous pto allowance at the begging of hire/start of the year lots of smart people around (not necessarily your boss)efficiency is super (not much bs) very civilized environment, decent workplace culture. good benefits but very long hours. management can be friendly or very rigid, depends on teams. to succeed at amazon, you really do need to drink the koolaid and subscribe to their peculiar ways. this is a place where you are given enormous latitude to chip in to solve problems. your role is defined by what you want to drive and own, not by a title. i appreciate the autonomy that amazon gives its leaders - for good and bad. we are given room to make mistakes, learn and grow from them.

at amazon. there are a number of teams working on different products across all sorts of areas.the best part is that the work which you do will get shipped.that's the main thing which i love about amazon. software you write will see light of day in say 6 months. that's how quickly things move here. teams are small and ownership is more. process is lightweight and will never hinder you. i have never been asked to fill in time-sheets or made to give hourly estimates. people are friendly. technical arguments are settled based on data and with respect.amazon does most of its development in java and uses a lot of open-source software. this frees engineers to focus on problems rather than re-engineer software which already exists.although some teams have poor work-life balance, the ones which i have worked in had no such problems. i have been able to do a 9-5 on most days without any work carrying over to the weekends. if you are fresh out of college, you can learn a lot in a short

have all done undercover investigations & reports on their facilities. as mentioned in the title, i've only worked on one team at amazon, and it is in the context of a new/secret project, so i'm not

online retailing using multiple competing teams to achieve components of an initiativepays well in general, there are great people rules are clear and it is what it is, amazon is the place to work hard with a médium salary. benefits are on average when comparing to the market. the pay was good especially for someone straight out of high school well, the atmosphere is laid-back, and the job is essentially easy. overall, nice people to work with. for some quick money during the holidays, it wasn't bad. however, they massively downsize again after the holiday season. the actual employees at amazon are awesome, and that's where the pros stop. they hire people who cannot not get a job anywhere else and they treat them like under developed people.they talk down the employees. majority of the warehouse workers are not college educated and non-professional.the coppell texas amazon management, treat the hourly employees like work horses. good benefits excellent learning opportunity great

company they pay weakly - yes weakly- as little as they can get away with pay can be great when they are not offering vto. monthly bonus based on building performance and your attendance. stock after 90 days, that you have to allow to rest for two years aka you can't sale it until 2 year. the stock is yours after 90 days if you claim it, yes even if you quit or are fired. again you can't sale it though, you have to wait two years. health, vision, and dental are all very cheap. easy to apply to another department or facility as long as you don't have write ups. they will pay 95 percent of your college tuition up to a certain dollar amount. jeff bezos seems to care. they are always asking the opinion of the employees. plenty of teams to choose from with top level developers modern facility, a sense of community, anybody could work here. if there is no work, they offer vto (voluntary time off) either before the day, at the start of the day, during the day. you don't get paid but you don't lose the vacation or paid hours they give you as benefit. great if you are a student or you have personal errands to do.i get $2500-$3000/yr from morgan stanley stock share. friendly people, and

$1,000 per peak season for each peak season you work up to 5 peaks. i can't think of a single thing. it's awful. the benefits do not outweigh the massive cons. i wouldn't recommend this job to anyone security, benefits, availability of overtime. pretty much different hours that you can workokay pay excellent compensation, amazing infrastructure, massive data, challenging problems very friendly people. decent pay. great benefits, solid pay, opportunities to move up in the company quickly, positive attitudes. great autonomy - if you want to jump into a big project, you can often go ahead. there isn't a lot of bureaucracy. if you have a good idea and can prove its value, you can work on it. cool embedded startup culture embodied in 'its always day one'. everyone thinks because is amazon your making good money and have a great job. culture, hr, employees (most), benefits, pay. problem was the job was exactly as described. lots of walking, many stairs, and it was the 6:00 pm to 6:30 shift. i \"thought\" i could handle it. i was so very wrong. wednesday, from 8:00 am to about 1:00 pm - no issues. just how-tos kinda things. thursday was first shift. they took us around, trained us and gave us a tour. very wearing. 2nd night, half way through the shift, i had to leave. i am no longer physically able to do this kind of job. i think if it had just been a day job on the first floor, i could have handled it (would only have gotten $10.50 an hour if it was). but a combination of being on the 4th floor and the walking and, especially, the time of night killed me. i was feeling faint and disoriented. called in the next morning and submitted my resignation. went back a week later and spoke with hr. because i was unable to give them at least a week's notice, i will not be eligible for rehire at amazon for 2 years. this does sadden me, but there is no way, physically, i could have given them a week. i will be losing the toe nails (i know tmi) on one foot. and this is with good shoes and socks. my body just rebelled against me. of course, i am almost 70. but i saw people handling the job that were 400 lbs. i exercise, i am not over weight, and i walk. a lot. but that didn't help me.bottom line, amazon is a great place to work but be aware of your physical limitations if you are looking at a job in fulfillment. sorting out the pickers orders and preparing the

atmosphere for a newly joined employee good pay, great bonuses stock after first 2 years and then once a year. they have pretty good benefits. bonuses exist, though they are usually very small. the

is what you make it-- if you can accept the fast-paced, high stakes, \"no excuses\" work environment, there is no limit to what you will achieve. you will look back in disbelief over how much you have grown in a year. 100% telecommute. decent amount of time given for time off (tho, as a seasonal employee, you miss some perks of any paid vacation. appears to be a very good system in place for learning in all levels, tho i am very new so only have access to the newbie training. very extensive and informative knowledge center allows for plenty of independent exploration. the best company ever. they were easy on the employees and gave out prizes i cannot yet compose a review of all the pro (s) i am certain to experience whilst being an amazonian. i was one of the first 100 candidates to attend the amazon hiring event in sept. 2016. unfortunatly, a few miscommunication challenges, delayed my onboarding. i remained relentless, professionally tenacious...amazon i my gateway to reinventing myself . for this i know, i will achieve promotions, contribute ideas and finally enjoy going to work everyday i worked from home was the only pro of this company. good place to work, fun culture, freedom to do new things. the management really cared about your safety awesome paybootyi am good at what i do team, product and project ownership - this by far is one of the best things

code for management. you solve real word problems as an intern. amazing work culture & amazing salaries for everyone you will get bored here. with the amount of training, the fast pace of the company, and how easy internal transfers are, you will always have something to stimulate your brain. in a lot of other tech giants, you will end up using half of your energy on 'visibility', meaning making sure your n+2 and n+3 know you, and sometimes doing projects just for the sake of it, but of no real added value for the company this is almost entirely not true here, of course you need to get exposure, but then again this is the most data driven company i have ever been at. if your project sucks, then people will automatically see during the weekly review. also, i find people to be more humble than back in google, even though they are also extremely smart. part of this is coming from the 'have backbone' leadership principle. people will disagree a lot with you, just to make sure your decisions are backed by data. nice culture where you will love to work have fun work had make history excellent work cultureimportance for our opinion nice environment, work is hard, lots of challenges but it is fun. dynamic company, that is flat, innovative, you get stocks, flexible, pretty fast paced company to work. i always felt like i was doing something and thought th experience was

ladder. most operations are still being establish within the amazon corporation and as a result numerous points of view are actively being considered. supportive environment, interesting and

how well i perform not only as a staff member but a mangement leader - high pay and no income tax (in seattle): this is the main reason people take a job offer from amazon.- brand recognition: the

place to work. you can learn a lot here from your colleague and your boss. awesome work environment. coworkers always willing to lend a hand to help me learn more and grow my career. nothing special about this job there are a lot of great things about working at amazon as a recruiter. it's the fastest-growing large company in the world, so it has a lot of resources and a lot of challenges that will help you improve as a recruiter. most of the people you work with, especially the teams you support, are extremely smart and fun people. amazon is a well-known and a (mostly) sought-after employer. you help build teams that build products that impact tens or hundreds of millions of people and often make the news. they are slowly but steadily improving the benefits to their employees - more supportive parental leave policies, more liberal internal transfer policies, better offices/buildings. they also generally pay well against the overall market. they are a challenging place to recruiter as well; while that can be less than fun at times, it means you will become a better recruiter quickly. i'm pretty confident that someone who can successfully work at amazon for a year or two can go on to be successful at pretty much any other company. they also have nice little perks like fishbowls (talks or performances by popular speakers or up-and-coming bands) and the holiday/summer party were fun. they offer really good insurance, and the discount on amazon.com is decent. amazon was the best career move for me. the benefits are great and the people i work with i

culture! the best part of the company is that you can freely approach anyone. there are tons of smart people, something that i really missed when i left. also, the company definitely takes a long-term focus, which is another thing that i sorely missed when i went to a company that was focused on the extremely short-term you will learn a lot the people are nice to work with the work ethos and expectations for exceed any business i have worked for previously. only met when i previously owned two businesses.i have networked and developed much thanks to personal experience with fellow managers. a year at amazon would equate to 3-5 years personal development and growth with other businesses. like the schedule & hours access to new tools and cutting edge technology. ability to transfer departments. very easy work, weekly pay and free dental for part time associates. great as a second income if you already have a full time job. pto, vac time and benefits also nice break room

management is horrible, most have no idea how to do their job. you make 10 a hour, not enough to feed 1 person let alone a family. the only pro is you work from home fun work and fun people. gettin to be part of such a fast growing company. getting to make decisions by myself without senior leadership. good working environment in the team great benefits, great people, management generally remains open to suggestions and are always brainstorming about how to keep their team motivated. provides opportunity for great ownership, to thrive in culture of organized chaos and have fun during the journey. ok pay, easy hire, friendly employees no pros. run from this company. run run run run run run run run away as fast as you can. set schedule. possibility to work overtime when it is offered. given time off (even though it is only unpaid time off.) benefits, upward mobility if you are willing to relocate. decent pay. good exercise. we really enjoy what we do for the customers no pros in my

delivering great value and features for them (not for us) you have to appreciate this thinking to do well here - please don't come over thinking its about quotas and bragging rights. we celebrate

genius, and you feel lucky to work at amazon at this stage in the company's life cycle. at first i did not notice it, but after working here for a while i realized i had become a much better

multicultural environment very good work atmosphere and you will never get frustrated from your work fast pacerewards performancehigh growthsmart co-workerspositive challenges all good. its grtt to work here good work, great things to learn scope of learning is good i like the freedom and the environment of amazon amazon really know how to treat employes and it has stood one level up in “employee satisfaction “. it hires the best and gives the best - it dose what is says “work hard, have fun, make history”i have personally not seen other companies following their principles as strictly as this one does.growth is radical and never ending learning, and ocean of knowledge.huge platform to prove yourself and no politics or favouritism is entertained. you get to work with some of the smartest people in the industry. the environment is very competitive, you would stand out as a sore thumb if you are not performing as well as the others.the work is quite interesting depending on what aspect of amazon you are working on. you get to work with latest technologies in the field. you are expected to be a self starter and have the ability to learn on the job and adapt to rapidly changing work priorities.you should be flexible with your work hours as you might be working weekend when the work is real crazy. compensation is fair, work is interesting, and opportunities are vast. 1. customer focus is truly priority #1 throughout the organization.2. long term focus of management means consistent message and direction.3. plenty of smart people, and very few places for the \"dead weight\" to hide.4. very easy, and expected, to rotate through various functional areas of the company. most people switch roles at least every 2 years. amazon has a variety of interesting business and technical challenges which continually provide an opportunity for fun work and fun problems. i started at amazon after college and i feel that i'm a better software engineer now that i would have been had i been employed elsewhere.i also feel that amazon does a good job of allowing ideas and solutions to bubble up from the bottom. in my experience at the company, i feel that i've been given a great degree of freedom to develop software that i want to develop when i can demonstrate that my solution is superior to existing ideas. there is a lot of freedom, and the sense of ownership is really valuable. groups are small and usually pretty nimble. logic usually prevails rather than politics. the customer focus feels nice, and the scale things operate is great. there is always more to learn on both the technical and business fronts, and you don't have a multi year personal backlog then you've got blinders on. if you like a challenge then it is a pretty nice place to work. good, profitable company to work at. it's really one of the very few retail companies that are doing well despite the current economic downturn. the company truly values and is, indeed, obsessed with serving customers...so that is a good side (maybe good for long term) during peak season there is opportunity to work a large amount of overtime. the pay is reasonable for the job. although not all of the bosses are good, my boss is amazing. i feel a sense of accomplishment when i leave work. amazon is a brand-name company which looks excellent on a resume. it will probably give you an inside shot at joining a good startup when you're ready to move on. you get a fair amount of freedom in how you do your job. the base pay is decent for the seattle area, if perhaps not so much nationally. and most of the non-management people i've come across will go out of their way to be helpful. great place to work, smart people, innovative culture, good benefits and good growth you can learn a lot in a short period of time. lots of smart people and they run a tight ship which is all good. a great place to start your career or until mid level very bad company too much politics, every one pretend they are expert. if i can i will choose 0 rate good salary, all expenses paid, lots of interesting work, signing on bonus and invested stocks after 1 year great place to learn about processes, scaling offering and learning to do more with less resources. after a while the learning curve stops. everything was good. from the time i joined since the time i left the experience was great. you will get to learn a lot it was temporary or finished and amazon said to the job is fished work friendly environmentyoung working crowdno work pressuregood facilities and perks i have spent 5 years at amazon and i just love this organization for the objectivity and transparency that exists. you are constantly on your toes and i do not think you will learn so much at such a fast pace anywhere else. you are allowed to experiment and take risks and remuneration is top notch. best in the class. large company lots of talk about improvments and opportunitys to move up and onwards nice environment,transport facility,food coupon,50 leaves in year you own your own work it looks good on a resume. the visibility of the company may allow you to catch the eye of recruiters in the future. name recognition. free candy. color printer. coffee comes quickly and often. as it is required for someone to submit a comment that has a minimum of 100 words, a brief sentence to explain what is necessary can be used to do the needful. run-on sentences comparing unnecessary aspects were popular in previous corporations where once i worked. how at this point can one bring oneself to reflect upon such experiences yet get some complication out of simplicity can boggle one's mind briefly. if you take advantage of the discounts, you can save a good bit of money. you definitely get recognised for doing good work and you can quickly earn respect throughout the company if you earn it. comp time is easy to arrange if you have a decent manager. i had an amazing time working with amazon. many learning and growth opportunities. if you are talented and interested, you can move to any field in amazon. work culture is at par with any other company. there are lots of smart people around. most of the people are

bunch about operations if you are open minded and have a good manager. state-of-the-art systems and good benefits. you get to say you work for amazon, which turns a lot of heads. looks incredible on a resume. the leadership principles come off as a bunch of cultish mumbo jumbo but they're actually very applicable to daily life and are great as leadership ideals. it can be a lot of fun to work there on certain days. you get free reign to try your ideas, just be ready to quantify any gain or loss of hours before and after execution. world class experience, extremely smart peers autonomy over all

my previous job was full of time-serving pot plants, so my bar was pretty low after that, but coming to amazon felt like a night and day improvement for a number of reasons.my standard answer when people ask me if i like working at amazon, my answer is \"the idiot ratio is low\". you will be working with smart, committed people and spend a much smaller amount of time dealing with idiots than i have experienced in the past. i've now had 3 managers, 2 of which were awesome and 1 whom i think should not be a manager. one good thing about amazon is that it's pretty easy to switch teams (after you've been in a team for a year). this allowed me to move to a manager and organization that i trusted.amazon is very good at focusing on things that matter (hence the title of my post). the leadership principles are used every day and that is really helpful if you're a software developer to prevent people from wasting time on things that are 'cool' but don't have an impact on the real world. yes, it means you don't get to spend lots of time refactoring code or using the latest fad nosql database but it does mean that that you're forced to try and maximize your impact on the customer. in the long run i feel like doing a job where your work feels valued is better than having a perfectly architected codebase. - health benefits begin first day- minimum 4% monthly bonus based on attendance with an additional 4% monthly bonus based on warehouse output (doubles to 8% for both during oct-dec)- overtime opportunities- friendly relaxed atmosphere- shift/department transfer requests accepted after 90 days- 4 day work week- competitive pay, including an annual pay review of similar jobs in the area- substantial shift differential for night shift employees- tuition assistance (career choice program)- pay raise every 6 months great company with lots of growth opportunities get paid to exercise in the warehouse decent pay and low barrier to entry for a warehouse grunt. leadership team was generally supportive. if you're not a complete dolt you can move up from baseline positions pretty quick. good health insurance if you are full time. lots of incredibly intelligent people and challenging problems +autonomy+smart people+industry leader+good stamp on your resume+poor performers tend to wash out quick the team has been excellent. active, innovative, lots of things to do and things to learn. pager duty varies from team to team, some do not have it at all. interesting projects, a lot of promising ideas to be implemented. the outside a great company. autonomy- no one is going to tell you how to do your job. you decide the best way.business process - amazon has a different way of doing things. yes, they do write 1-6 page documents to prepare for meetings rather than putting thoughts into a powerpoint presentation. then they spend the first 10-20 minutes of the meeting quietly reading it. yes, they do encourage healthy debate to a level that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. in the end this makes for better business decisions.mobility - once you've been here for a year and had a decent review, it's very easy to move around. get to bring your dog to work, very nice people, very smart people opportunities to work with full-time team members on many of the same tasks. lots of respect from other employees. challenging work.great people to work with. good pay, flexible hours, an environment with a lot of really smart people that you will learn a lot they offered a lot of overtime, you can work from home good atmosphere and diverse workforce at the entry level great brand to have on the resume. the company is doing some very interesting projects. opportunities to transfer across division is a great benefit. great pay. steady work. overtime. freefast-pacedfriendly co-workerseasy jobssafe environmentgood facilitiesgood spirit of customers service working from home was an ease, pay was good, management was top notch. good pay, good benefits, easy work, stock, tuition help, book reimbursement hours pay are pretty good will hire anyone and you can walk around all day i just got a job with amazon and am very excited to start. great company with a big signing bonus! good working environment, good company culture, good salary and bonus...overall, right choice to work here! fast paced -i work with some honest, good people -the job is fun, fast paced, but most times, fun -it is work but not the hard work i grew up with - good pay paid every week laid back environment your development expertise will grow immensely. you are surrounded by some of the smartest engineers in the world, so you learn a lot what makes amazon unlike any other employer is its relentless focus on the organization's culture. this is not seen as just a responsibility of the \"management\". every employee who joins is encouraged to take ownership of the task and is also measured up by direct reports/peers/manager/leadership on how well they accomplish the same at the respective level they operate. with the scale at with amazon is growing in size, this element is critical in ensuring uniform employee experience. competitive on salary, employee friendly policies.another key usp for amazon is the talent group you work with. almost all hires are high performing individuals which means the overall bar of performance is also high. this is good for those who want to take on challenging (in every essence of the word) tasks & constantly want to improve the status quo. personally what stands out is how employees are encouraged to determine their own deliverables for the year and are measured not just on the end deliverables, but on what learning the initiatives brought and the quality of work put in. there is usually nobody micromanaging you or creating pressure on deadlines, the environment is such that you will yourself be compelled to deliver high quality work and reach out for help where you need. a combination of challenges, working with best minds and great support system. i get to do so many things in addition to what i was hired for. i love music and i do it at amazon too. friendly environment , feels like home . just an amazing place to work !! everyone is treated as a leader in amazon. there are so many opportunities to innovate and experiment. i don't do things here because someone has told me to do so. i do things because i believe they are the right things. i am expected to set my goals and also establish my value. i haven't found any other company

hands-on-mentalität, lokales management, internationales netzwerk, entwicklungsmöglichkeiten gutes + junges teamvielseitige tätigkeiten + verantwortung it varies from team to team but i had the opportunity to work on some amazing stuff that made me learn a lot about scale and infrastructure that goes along with such a huge eco-system. another thing that surprised me was how smart a lot of the folks working here actually are. competitive pay, interesting work, opportunities to work in many fields. opportunities to work with a lot of very talented people. good package and benefits. working with great minds good benefits if hired by amazon; availability due to large number of workers needed for six weeks in peak season; good as seasonal job through iss (but without benefits) good work culture, independence, start-up like work environment was good experience as an intern here but it definitely depends on what team you're on.learned a lot for just $11.00x hr. they are transforming a human worker into a human-robot... honestly, there was nothing positive about working at this facility. it was just plain awful and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. when you put it on, it feels like it was custom made for you. you feel invincible. you can you anything and you want to wear it forever. enjoy many of the people that i work with. also, i like the idea of swag bucks received when your hard work is noticed. i learned a lot. amazon employs some very smart people who've done good work solving some very hard problems. if you want to know about scaling, look no further.there's no question that having amazon on your cv is good for your career. for all those who are aspiring to join amazon and those who are newly joined, these are my advices. please don't get overawed by the facilities they offer like ac cabs, beverages, food coupens, laptops, water bottles, goodies etc. these are certain things which your previous organizations might not have offered you. but there will come a stage where you will realize that these were offered to you so that you think great about the company and work really really hard and sincere forgetting your personal life completely. and if you don't have an understanding life partner he or she might even divorce you, for you will be glued to your laptop always. you will have enough opportunities to learn and improve your skills good work-life balance and great work encironment if work is the most important thing to you right now, amazon uk is a good place to do it. incredibly fast pace of growth means a large amount of varied and interesting projects to take responsibility in with equally driven people. however you'll be expected to juggle this alongside your day-to-day role with no impact on your category deliverables, hence the need to be able to absolutely dedicate yourself to the job if you want to get anywhere and not have a breakdown. you will give up plenty of evenings and weekends if you intend to be there for a few years.promotion can be achieved but you need to be political - identify tools or fixes that will improve most categories, figure out a scalable way to deliver them and start shouting about them. peer reviews and cross-category influence are key to progression whatever level you're at. true of every company to an extent, but you'll quickly see how amazon takes that and everything else to the nth degree. good package and i suggest it to every fresher to try for it and get selected and if selected they provide high salary and very good incentives initial salarysmart people who had joined earlier. there are none, it all seems great if you can get through the tough interview process but trust me you don't want to work for them. 1) learning: working under pressure will let you lean a lot of stuff.2) corporate experience: you will have a corporate experience and how it works. but you will swear after not to work in any corporate again. challenging projects. great people to work with. hours, good people, benefits feedback from those you pick is taken in consideration for performance ratings. can leave when you want as long as you have hours. . stretch before work your hard work gets noticed, by managers and tier 3s alike (tier 3 is a position that is somewhat equivalent to an assistant manager at other employers, but they directly manage the bulk of resources in the areas that they're assigned). you can be trained in other areas in your working area if those above you think you can handle it. at date of hire, you receive up to 4 days off, in the form of -1-10 hr block of vacation time, 1-10 hr block of paid personal time, and 20 hrs of unpaid personal time.vacation time must be submitted for approval no less than 24 hours before the time you wish to be off, the paid personal time can be used whenever you like, and the same with the unpaid personal time. you get up to two weeks , 1 week of vacation and 1 week of paid personal, and every quarter, you accrue 2 extra unpaid days. you can have up to 80 hours of unpaid time accrue before you max out, you lose all of your 1 week personal time if you don't use it by the end of the year, and my understanding is that vacation time can be accrued for an unlimited amount of time. after your first year, you receive double the amount of vacation time to accrue throughout the year. remember, all of that time takes the whole year to accrue, so every pay period, you get a little more that you can use in whatever type of increments you decide. insurance benefits aren't too bad, if you're single, or have a spouse/domestic partner... if you have a family, still not the worst that i've seen, but fairly standard...(see below) for advancement and promotional capabilities, amazon.com is also great if you're single and/or have a specific type of spouse/domestic partner...(see below) 401 k is pretty standard for the industrial warehousing industry. after being there for predetermined amounts of time (2 years, then 3 years), you receive a few units of stock at both intervals, which is nice...(see below) you may receive a small monthly bonus, based on the whole facility performance, so that's definitely good..(see below)amazon.com also has tons of leave types available for emergency situations or personal issues, but really could benefit from enforcing the laws concerning certain types of leave...(see below)they also have an ethics line, for employees who feel like they're being slighted, or have seen something they feel or know is wrong. (see below)tuition reimbursement - wonderful... amazon has a pretty good tuition program. you have to be an amazonian for over a year before it can be used, but they'll pay up to 12k for certain college courses, usually a technical certificate, or certificate of some kind. it's supposed to be up to 3k, spread out over a years time, but they're pretty flexible on that because of the limited number of available programs that you can finish over a few years time period... and they also pay for your text books related to the program/classes you're taking. really, really nice.pay isn't bad, for a warehouse, unskilled, position either...starting out.(see below)in the end, amazon.com isn't a bad place to work, it's really great for hardworking, high achieving, single people, or people who don't have families, or people with a college degree before you start at amazon. work life balance, good hours meet new people and make friends, contests to win amazon products, 2 breaks and 1 lunch,

to work with a wonderful group of people on my team. these factors, a great company culture and a great team, make amazon a fabulous place to work for me. amazon work groups have great autonomy to work independently and provide superior results. we are empowered via the amazon leadership principles to place big bets and take calculated risks. amazon is a technology company. as a technologist, i can think of no greater company to work for. living and working in seattle at amazon headquarters is an invigorating experience on many levels: technical challenges, technical autonomy, decision

looking for challenge and want to be part of history then amazon might be the place for you. most companies have some leadership principles. amazon has its own version too. however, unlike many companies, i see it being valued and put to work in every aspect of the business.this is a company where the following are valued (in my opinion):* thinking it through before jumping in (it's okay to say 'i'll get back to you with the data'),* pace of delivering results in the face of uncertainty (a.k.a. a good mix of resourcefulness and hustle),* seeking guidance from mentors and getting feedback from peers and experts (having an ego can be detrimental)* thinking big (a.k.a. scaling up, be it a service, or number of customers)* having a data-backed opinion (providing recommendations and improving processes/technologies are encouraged) opportunity for growthcompetitive payopen door policy - incredibly talented and experienced people working here- great growth and innovation culture-

for amazon at seattle. what i like most about working at amazon is the ability to make large scale impact on the way the world buys stuff. and i get to do that of my own accord. autonomy, independent thinking and ownership are encouraged here better than any other place that i know of. amazon is a great place for builders and if you enjoy building things (robots at home, software at work, the works...) - then you will love working here.as you will hear a lot of amazonian's say \"there is scale and then there is amazon scale\". i do not know of any other place that provides the cusp of physical scale and computing scale that amazon provides. physically moving goods across the world based on some person clicking a buy now button on the website - and doing it a very large number of times very day - brings with it some very interesting (including several unsolved) problems. it is a lot of fun to work on such problems.amazon is also a place that rewards diversity of thinking and approach. that has brought together a whole bunch of very interesting and smart people. i learn a lot every day that i show up at work. amazon also has one of the most flexible internal move policies - so it is super easy to find something within the company that you are interested in working on and start working on it!it is a very fast paced environment where something is happening all the time.

innovate, brainstorm, share ideas. i enjoyed my time working at an amazon warehouse. the fast pace was great and the physical work was good for the body. however, if you are looking for a job that does not require you to sweat than this rating should read a one for you instead of the four that i selected. this was my only warehouse/assembly job, but i had heard from other employees, towards other employees that were complaining, that amazon pays more for less work and has better safety and employee mindset than the other warehouses around town. again that is hearsay and i cannot personally confirm this statement, but that is what i heard many times a lot of responsibility, fast-paced, and you learn a lot. percentage in stock and discounts within site - great work environment-

smart people and you will learn a lot really fast. you can also grow fast if you are willing to risk your personal/family life for a few years to get there. if you are money hungry and will do anything for money, this is a great place for you as the money will come. fyi the glassdoor comments are true. please read. it is not disgruntle employees that write these reviews. its real people trying to give you the real truth so you can make an informed decision. challenging. work with smart people. lots of data to check yourself on decisions. great compensation, dogs at work, challenging work dynamic and fast paced environment. great associates. awesome customer focus and extensive automated tools to aid individual and group tasks. world class facilities. i am very proud to have been a part of amazon. it could be a frustrating place to work, but it was never boring. i have never felt so mentally stimulated. good for development for a new hire. you'll learn a lot from peers. good money too. powerful business model on core retail business that drives seemingly unlimited growth. the basic principle that the company was built on which by driving lower prices it can fuel sales, gain leverage and reduce costs from vendors to further reduce prices fuel growth, etc. is brilliant due to its simplicity. in order to be successful this model requires long term thinking and jeff bezos is famous for that, which allows folks to focus on projects that may add a lot of value 5+ years down the road. this also leads to plenty opportunities for innovation, which are key in creating a sustainable business.another pro is the fact that the company focuses on three things that do not change no matter what the economy does: great prices, great selection, great customer experience. no matter what the state of external elements might be, focusing on these three things gives a company an edge.finally its obsession with customer satisfaction is a lesson to be learned. being in that environment gives a unique perspective on how to manage a business that needs to be seen in practice to truly absorb. i'll never complain about the advancement opportunities at amazon. i was able to move around quite a bit in the company which kept the boredom off 1. challenging and helpful to write all these different topics2. as regarded, you will get lots of help from team mates when needed good opportunity to work on real-world scaling problems.lots of new project initiatives, and still some good challenges in migrating from legacy systems. work with different technologies, in a highly scalable environment. not a lot of structure. i have hope that my experience isn't the norm as i've been with the company for about a year (but these reviews imply it is) - but this company is not great. however, it is a good name to have on your resume - so probably a good place for people without a lot of experience or are looking to only stay somewhere for a few year. can be exciting with authors and bands stopping bylots of room for lateral movement within company10% employee discount bands come by and play conference rooms promoting cd's. author's come by and do book signings for

are proactive with your career and engage your management actively, you can go almost anywhere. - compensation is good, but tied primarily into the stock. the better the company does, the better you do. - darwinistic culture means you generally work with some solid people. - customer is the focus and not in the company jargon sense, but really the core foundation of everything we do. - this is a writing culture, be prepared to write well thought and constructed 6 pagers. they have great benefits if you are hired on regular and not through an agency, they have many incentives that they have

around me and this is the most rewarding part of working for amazon. despite my low star-rating there were a few perks available when working for the fulfillment center. there is a machine that dispenses terrible but free coffee in some of the break rooms. there is a half-hearted attempt to provide some climate control in the heat of the summer months. the price of health benefits are somewhat reasonable for a single person such as myself. quite a few vacation days are offered which is wonderful because you'll need every one of them! what i have liked the most about working for amazon is, all the technology and mechanics i get to play with. in the facility i work in, we have so many different types of conveyance, it had given me a chance to learn pretty much everything there is to know about how the mechanics work. i had no prior experience coming in the door, i started in production packing, picking, ic/qa etc and was able to land a job in the maintenance shop. i have had a wonderful experience learning and being able to teach others. learning how to maintain and rebuild sorters and conveyance has given me a great push in the right direction. also ensures that customers will have top notch experience!! our benifits are outstanding as well! you are in control of your future. opportunities are available at amazon to anyone willing to work to move up in the

cycle.- sde does work in multiple areas - some development, some qa, some pm, ...- encouraged to explore new technologies and get experience for other teams.- brilliant, knowledgeable and friendly coworkers- friendly management style. customer focus reigns supreme. lots of smart people. very clear focus on what they want to do. if you are fresh out of college, amazon can be a great place to pick up loads of skills. you wind up (mostly) managing your own projects end to end, so you wind up learning about build, deployment, system administration, schema design, as well as any coding required for the task. you also learn about scalablity. and of course, you get to work with lots of cool distributed technologies. there's something to be said for having software that runs on hundreds of servers. there are a few nice perks as well, such as a free bus pass and occasional keggers. the environment is pretty relaxed in that you don't have to dress up or watch what you say. small teams encourage start-up-like mentality and working environment. compensation is top-notch. all teams are limited to some 8-9 people, which allows each person to assume a comprehensive role covering all aspects of software development. the job also gives very interesting technical challenges. i get to work with very bright, very customer focused people, who are also genuinely decent and caring individuals. i get to work on some amazing technology and i can see how it will change the world when it is in the hands of our customers. senior management is smart, intense, focused, and

departments, worked at a fast pace, able to do internal interview so kept up on my interview skills. atmosphere of continuous innovation makes it an interesting place to work. lots of smart people, and in many cases people have a decent sense of humor - which is really , really key to working at amazon. for the most part everyone is trusted to get their stuff done, so there is not much in the way of micro-management. casual work environment with dogs welcome. in general, amazonians are well-compensated, and the stock is blowing it out right now. offers a fast-paced environment and an excellent learning experience in terms of working with technology and e-commerce. you'll get to work on a lot of cool and interesting problems decent pay, overtime, monthly bonus, free stuff good pay

environment to be in. great internal support with plenty of opportunists to move up. leadership team has excellent grip on employee very interesting technology and things move very fast. if you're a technologist, you won't get bored easily although really understanding the inner workings of things is tough to learn as things are shrouded in intentionally unnecessary secrecy. this gets old fast if you're genuinely curious and want to learn more about things.generally smart, hardworking, quality people although some teams mission and function (mine in particular) appeared to have not been very well thought out. tons of ambiguity without strong leadership and direction on how team members can \"get an a\" or how to \"crush it\" and do well. tough environment for people who like to feel like they are getting things done and winning. it will make you feel like you're failing, even if you're not and they try to get in your head with the values stuff. while metrics are everything there, things still remained very nebulous. in fact, in the role i was in, i rapidly figured out the job function wasn't needed and didn't particularly make any sense or bring much value (to selling the products or making the products), even if the team charter had been fully realized. many folks on the team tried to make it what they could but were relatively ineffective. there may very well be good pockets in other groups but this was my experience and it was a poor fit for me personally. great part time, flexible schedule. more hours can be added as needed. great holiday perks and food periodically. good starting wageeasy work load i worked as both a stow and pick associate at an amazon fulfillment center for a combined total of about a year, six months in each position. here are some generalized pros+ up and moving about.+ simple work+ flexible scheduling+ paid time off+ overtime+ great benefits+ good option for students looking to work while in school (at least for me it was) i liked working there because you always stayed busy. most of the people i worked with were great. when i worked at picking i would walk upwards of 2 miles a day which was great exercise. challenging project, flat management style dynamic work environment with ideas/process improvement can be initiated at the ground level. free coffee. high pay, always something to do, and employees are friendly clear job definition and responsibility. nice team to work without any issue. recommend to work for amazon if any chances. good pay and good benefit. just got accepted here, nice benefits and pay scale. the train you to operate machinery, which is a major plus. good benefits, great developmental programs, good atmosphere. there is so much going on at amazon that you can feel the buzz as you go around the campus. your colleagues are smart and driven. moving around the company is encouraged and you get new experiences. it is the closest thing to a meritocracy that i have ever been a part of although that seems to be changing slightly as the company gets bigger. it's cool to be a part of a company that is so often spoken about in the news. when you tell people that you work for amazon they usually tell you how much they love prime and about their most recent shopping experience. smart people; plenty of opportunities to deal with ambiguity fun environment, lots of autonomy. i had a lot of opportunities given to me in which i could have succeeded. dogs allowed in the office was an exceptional thing as well. high performance bar, fast pace awesome job...friendly environment. the salary is good and also the growth rate is high compared to other companies. - you get to work with amazingly talented and helpful people- the compensation is really good- the office atmosphere is

in other multinational company in slovakia cab -home to home facility is simply awesomesodexogreat, friendly and young crowd - environment makes you feel at home there is almost zero politics in this company and you are judged only on the basis of your performance regardless of tenure. awesome place to work to amazon is a superb company to work with .. very employee friendly work environment compensation is great. signing bonuses great. endless opportunity to advance ecommerce amazon is indeed a very peculiar place to work. there are a lot of opportunities to move around, intelligent people, there is never a dull moment and diverse culturally. my experience has been positive so far, but it differs from team to team. i've known people who left the company due to a bad experience with management. they either left at their own or were fired. the relocation package is very generous and the hiring team does an excellent job of recruiting talents. working with great talented set of people, opportunities for cool projects this is a company that really sticks by its principles, especially customer obsessionyour career path is your own to determine, i've always been supported in my changes (can also be a negative, see below)you are building cool things that affect lots of people around the worldnever a dull moment, ever nice pay. work in teams of some of the most brilliant minds you will ever meet. you will work on the most innovative projects within the industry and company. great support from software engineers. operations is still main focus of company so you can come up with the ideas to make a difference and receive the support you need to get the job done and improve efficiency and reduce costs. i spent 10 years at amazon starting from engineer to growing into senior manager. i did software development, program management, product management and even some online marketing.if you get opportunity to get into ground floor of a new initiative or business and are lucky enough that the initiative has executive attention and becomes a business and starts growing it will do wonders for you:1/ you will learn first hand how businesses develop in online world2/ you will learn how to operate efficiently (very limited resources - people and funding, and many idea - makes decision making and product pivoting crucial)3/ your career will grow fast within the companyi have outlined idea scenario that does occur in parts of the company. albeit to lesser and lesser degree as company has grown a lot and become somewhat of a different beast. so if you are looking at the company and are serious about your investment of years there - be very sensitive to group you go to. you can land at a group that is bigger and older but if so, perform as well as you can and then you must switch to smaller - new business starting group. otherwise you will be one of many who often complain about the company:- only ops, hardly get to write lot of code or ground breaking software, too much internal tribal knowledge- burnout - big group - crazy boss driven beaurocracylastly, amazon is place for those who persevere in times of troubles - keep that in mind! good benefits, stock options, vacation, personal time and unpaid time. smart, highly motivated team, initiatives that have direct customer impact, high visibility in the organization. own your product end-to-end from conception to implementation to delivery to maintenance. move anywhere in the country it is a big company and it has some fantastic web services. if you are one that wants to work a bunch of hours, you will be pleased to work about as much as you want especially in peak season. experience in face to face employee relations freedom in creative expression, you decide what to offer the world in turn you decide your own pay. no managers watching you. you log in and out with an iphone when you're not working in the warehouse (ie sprouts, bristol farms, etc). late/absence based on generous point system. management listens to what you have to say and considers it. weekly pay! everything is done on an app or online. * you get a lot of control over what you work on, and you feel like you can make an impact great co-workers, a lot of opportunities to learn benefits, time off options, opportunities for advancement, career choice program good agency management,but amazon staff

commute, voluntary time off when overstaffed, stock options, benefits are really good, quarterly bonuses based on performance. they pay well, but that's it ! i like working with amazon. i have had many awesome managers, and co-workers, great benefits, and amazon makes it a fun place to work. lots of great people young and old. opportunity to work on things that are interesting/innovative. the company puts a lot of ownership on employees, which is cool. compensation is great if you work for at least 3 years, because only then will the stock starts to vest. flexible work schedule. freely use your creativity to improve process and working conditions. great people and very supportive management. its a job. its better than nothing, and the work itself isn't all that bad. it's an easy job in

of the smartest, most capable people, on the most interesting problems. there are almost unlimited opportunities within the company. the work is certainly very interesting as amazon uses the latest tools and technology. and you will get to work with some exceptional people in the industry. amazon is not comfortable place to be for most people new to amazon. we do things differently and it is a steep learning curve. 95% of it is for a good reason, once you understand it. amazon is one of few places where goals and values are not artificially created, they actually came up from the long process of forming amazon culture and are alive at every level. amazon is bottom-up company. leadership does not dictate what to do - if you have good ideas, you can grow really fast here and make a difference. we are big. every team is somewhat different. we encourage you to move. jump in, find the right boss & project for you, work hard, have fun and make history - at amazon you can. cab facility,aircooler facility ,employee insurance talented people, great place to experiment with new initiatives, scaling massively. a job if you got no options good place to improve knowledge i started my career with amazon,chennai as a device associate. initially it was an awesome place to work. enjoyed myself to the core, earned decent and enough for a bachelor. learned a lot. but, a time came where career has to become a part of me, so i started expanding my career and started looking for a challenge, thats when i found out whatever i learned and did was not even 10% in what the industry is expecting. nice teammates, good laugh and nice company culture you make good friends and work environment is friendly. pressure is to high in fcs very good environment and nice workplace, good pay,annual leave,very supportive and encouraging when it comes to ideas proposed by employees. was given opportunity to invent and make changes interesting place to work and great benefits and pay. the process has been seamless (interviews, orientation, training). the team i work with have been amazing. it's amazing to be part of such an innovative company. we are constantly pushing boundaries of what is possible and accelerating delivery to the customer. fast paced environment. had a lot of fun. always very busy and not much standing around. good place to start your career and to have as a part-time job. weekly pay. great opportunities with a big company amazon is a good company to move forward. flexible working environment, new technology amazon is one of the most fast paced work environments i've ever witnessed. combined with the encouragement of innovation and owning your work you can choose to success or fail. if you are successful you are also well rewarded. ever changing environment with opportunity to grow but must not stay in one spot for too long. always look to move on to a new site. fast pace, engaging, professional work environment, surrounded by creative people, collective problem solving, teamwork, many opportunities to learn. - opportunity to work on innovative product- flexible work hours- free uber pool credit (up to $130/mo) i was pleasently surprised how engaging and strength-focused my team has been. since day one, i've been included in conversations that i feel like i have little reason being in beyond simply building and developing my own strengths and understanding of the overall business. amazon is very much focused on the leadership principles and propelling new hires into their desired careers. once you are in the door, you are 'one of the best' and they just want you to find the best fit for your abilities and desires. flexible working arrangements, less work than asia companies, challenging work, colleagues are smart. the company is really energetic and supportive of creativity, and my colleagues get things done. leaders can be convinced to change their minds if you put together a good case. fantastic benefits for the work that is performed. opportunities for internal advancement, both seasonal and permanent. college classes offered in the warehouse, free cdl courses. - fast paced- innovative- lots of resources to learn and grow- good career progression (if you deliver results and showcase amazon leadership principles) great benefits and pay. company gives employees stock high energy, fast pace envirnoment great experience, good opportunities to grow with the company opportunity ,insight, data, training, guidance a is a quick company; i could learn a lot; there are quite a lot charming products. it's easy to get hired. they don't discriminate. will hire anyone with high school diploma. the pay is biweekly and it is always on time. a few paid hours and vacation hours if fulltime employee. of the company - decent benefits, stable company, education reimbursement (but only for associates degree or training program ?) ( not sure if its worth it though!) very results driven culture where you see see your impactwork with bright people; very easy for internal transfer, which opens up many opportunities such a big, and fast growing company can offer.stock price ever increasing so compensation has been competitive.strong, recognized experience if you look for a job change i was an sde i at amazon for 1.5 years. the projects are at amazon scale, and the resources exist to tackle any problem. there are many smart engineers who bring valuable industry experience to their designs and feedback. generally meetings were productive. career advancement opportunities exist if you are proactive about finding them. you get lots of overtime opportunities, amazon gives all full time employees two shares of stock, and you only work a four day work week, you get a 25 cent raise every 6 months up to $1.50 from salary in which you started consistent hours and great people to work with the money is decent, especially around peak season. busy work pace, efficient, and coworkers all had positive mental attitude. this review is for amazon, but not for the amazon that most users of glassdoor might think of, the master-of-the-world amazon where digital overlords rule the realm of consumer goods from cubicle keyboards. i am talking about working at the warehouses, known as fulfilment centers. like me, you never planned to find yourself at such a job, but there are benefits.first let me say that that i don’t consider my job at an amazon fc as a career, but as i am working here after a long hiatus from the professional life, i found myself needing to make the most of the job. pride, pleasure, purpose. for each of these components of happiness, you will need to create your own narratives since, frankly, the company does a below average job providing you any.the work is physically hard and productivity is closely monitored, but, depending on your motivational needs at the moment, you can either consider this either the cheapest (that is, you are getting paid) or the most expensive (when considering the opportunity costs) ten hour aerobic workout you can ever get. get the most out of the sweat. all of those gym classes in those fancy gyms have nothing on the workout you can get at a warehouse. large amount of responsibilities, good amount of autonomy, good pay flexible hours you know what you're getting into. a lot of walking and lifting boxes but i enjoy the workout. great upper management the best part of working at amazon's sortation facilities as a part time associate is the steady hours at a variety of flexible times that let you work there in addition to another job. wagehoursbenefitsgrowth within companypeoplewagepeople fjfdadgbv xjfsx train your warehouse leaders better you get to work with very smart people on immensely important projects. the benefits are great. the pay is satisfactory. amazon is a good place to work if you are looking for career development and the benefits are good as well. actively learning new skills and facing daily challenges - competitive salary- intelligent coworkers- technology exposure if you like growth through struggle and constant learning, then definitely a pro data driven and customer focused makes decision making easy. most innovative company.lot of interesting projects.flexible work hours, work from home. good

pathgrowth and development amazon is incredibly frugal. teams have very minimal resources and yet own significant pieces of functionality. my team, in particular, owns a significant feature within the mobile application that millions of customers interact with every day. because of that, i’ve had the chance to deliver products of significant complexity and high visibility.amazon is also a very flat organization in which you own your own career progression. from my experience, that’s been a huge plus. work along side the best of the best. having the opportunity to work for a company who says they are customer obsessed and truly mean it. delivering technology and services that change people's lives for the better. growth opportunities in every direction. internal mobility options and job

truly cares for their employees, spoils them even. every feedback is implemented when it comes to the well-being of employees.> great leadership team who are ever-approachable and friendly without the hierarchical rule/ despotism.> people/ work culture here is amazing to work with. majority of the employees are highly motivated so it gets easier to work/ network across departments while handling/ launching a big project that involves multiple teams.> the site where i work at is extremely young with average age of 23 (approx.) and is always buzzing with a lot of energy. with events/ celebrations happening every other day, all the employees find it a lot of fun to come to work everyday!> all the team managers i have reported to/ worked with so far are fair and handle teams pretty decently. a place where you can build your career at very prior stage. good to have on your cv, new products new opportunities, new ideas. management team is good to work with. technology we deal with are amazing.things we do have a great impact on the customers and this gives a satisfaction(there is no point if you do implement something great but nobody uses it). co-workers here are really amazing, they have sound knowledge about the stuffs they deal with. this also makes you active all time, solving new interesting and challenging problems you get thrower in cold water and need to learn swimming very fastfast paced no dress code, free environment, free cab, free refreshment it has a best environment - international environnent- strong work ethic- great learning \"school\" for juniors / beginners- free in-house trainings and other compensation ( monthly lunch vouchers, refunded transportation, free coffee in offices, etc.) your mates are very excellent. you can learn a lot from them.open. most of the information are open to all developer inside company. great work atmosphere get to know lot of thinks and on how to work with multi-culture people. good salary. other than that i dont see much of pros in the company. pay is good in comparison and the benefits after a certain level is also very appealing. lots of learning happens as the company is growing at a rapid pace. the employee review process is very good. good benefitsif you are desperate for some liveable money, work here at the outset, i want to put a disclaimer that in case you find this outrageously positive in the tone of the feedback, it is actually and i might sound like i am obsessed with amazon, because, well i might be. i will also take the opportunity to say that this feedback is purely my personal opinion and does not represent the company in any way. i am doing this voluntarily because i want to.i can only tell what i learnt newly and in spite of being in the industry for many years, i felt i have learnt so many things and maybe, for the first time, actually got to see how institutionalized certain things are, though they seem to be not really alien in concepts in other companies as well. to start with, metrics as a way to define, both the problem and the solution. the concept is certainly not new to most companies, but not in the form i have observed and learnt at amazon. it actually becomes part of your dna where you habitually do it and not as a top down mandate.this takes us to the next logical step where we define goals for yourself and the team. i have not seen where this is not the case. but again, its in the way it is done at amazon. the way metrics are used to define these probably make a world of difference.next comes the leadership principles that amazon has so effectively come to represent. come to think of it, why would we want to hire anyone who doesn’t already have these imbibed in himself or herself. the focus on strong technical knowledge along with testing a person in terms of their leadership skills during an interview itself makes people proud of themselves. this pride multiplies as we become interviewers ourselves. again, typical of amazon, you don’t qualify to become an interviewer yourself because you are now in amazon. you go through a process called making great hiring decisions and for every interview, you have some one called a bar raiser who will ensure we are setting a relentlessly high standard in hiring. again, no company will want to make poor hiring decisions, but not many have such a well defined mechanism to ensure so. and again, this ties back to what jeff bezos always maintained, ‘good intentions don’t always work. good mechanisms do’.the last thing is the quality of people you work with. you work with a lot of intelligent people around you and, the best thing about amazon is the number of highly tenured employees you get to meet. nobody is above details and expectedly so. it helps you be on your toes all the time. when people always talk in terms of the leadership principles, it seemed pretty odd to me initially, but, not unsurprisingly, became a habit with me too as these principles really form the foundation of amazon.i haven’t talked a lot about the amazon leadership principles in particular because this is about my experience and not really something that can easily be googled for. the 3 days in a row off.voluntary time off can be quite often during slow timesbenefits are good.many positions opening constantly to. move up or just do something different. great co-workers and amazing lower level management. mid and high management will be in the cons section. great for showing off on your resume. benefits are okay, but seem to discourage families, as they are only affordable for single people with no one else to support. good payeasy to use appoverall good peopleavailable shiftsflexible hours/shiftsmore shifts during the busy seasonselect shifts for larger cars good benefits, some perks, independence good base pay, stocks, and medical benefits. cool environment and fun associates easy to get employment for seasonal part time and late night shifts available u get quick money better benefit. and better shift. it’s a lovely place to work in. easy interview and easy to get in it’s great work with amazon that allows me to get benefits good schedule and good pay - three factors contribute to ample work - fast growth, high churn and small teams. attractive for someone looking to acquire loads of new skills in short time- work-life balance is not as bad as people often warn. on most days, my team comes in around 9 and starts to leave around 5:30-6:00 flexible hours, vast amount of experience, and created position. -great pay-long hours (overtime)-great people you meet weekly paycoworkerscasual dress5 day work week will be exposed to both smart&dumb retail business details. great ppl to work with benefits are nice along with the people that you work with. pretty much anyone will help you while you are a picker since everyone knows that is the job that you do not want. but it is a job as far as a career, you may want to look elsewhere. fun place to work at. friendly environment, great benefits. hours work well with outta work activities. open door policy is welcoming you get to work with intelligent people. - full ownership of products makes it easy

learning experiences fast pace no work life balance if you like fast pace, friendly people and good benefits this is the place! i don't know, i wasn't able to ever start. you get plenty of time off. they pay 12hr they give you paid time off (pto) up to 40 hr and 60 unpaid to use when ever you want they give you an amazon stock every year health insurance and 401 k ,amazon discount, it's so easy labor, you could even leave amazon go home and come back to clock out, nobody would have any idea. because im able to work over night 99 percent of people are great to work with. good pay and you get hours. fun activities during peek, can move up with hard work, and pretty fun work environment good people. had a great time with other employees.. amazon has great benefits and u get to leave when ever u want! as long as u have time. amazon just in the name is a great company for any speech. although many people would avoid a warehouse classified job, it is a great opportunity for many people. salary and comp is very nice for okay work. you can make decent money during the peak season. smart people who take ownership. managers who don't get in the way and are above average. in general, you'll learn quite a bit. amazon has invested a lot in the development infrastructure. there are a lot of tools in place to make writing and deploying code easier; the learning curve can be steep but they really do focus on getting developers to a place where they are adding value. the team you work on will really impact how much you work and how intense your on-call is but my team has very reasonable expectations. i never work more than 40 hours a week and our on-call is very mild. this is not true for all teams. at amazon, they have mostly good people and a good management team overall. it offers challenges and opportunities. they have a very fast paced environment with some cool tools with opportunities to make a difference. innovative and past pace environment. have true ownership of your work. -very smart managers-always pushing the envelope 1. good pay at higher levels (sde 3+)2. excellent range of opportunities - work from ui to the largest web services infrastructure in the world to machine learning to consumer products (kindle).. if you get bored of one team, moving to another is straightforward.3. high achievers are rewarded well4. super focused and competent senior management you can bring your dog to work. sadly that is the only good thing i can say about this company. you may meet some smart and amazing people, but not at the upper management level. good exercise because i was working as a stower in one of the warehouses, putting books and dads on shelves. the rates increase over periods of time and it is very hard to make rate without cheating. this is because the rate is based on average rate of stowing so the more people cheat, the higher the rate goes up because you can put more books on shelves. well established company, with decent pay. they are always in need of people, easy to obtain job there. some potential to move up within the company. being able to go with the flow of working different places in the warehouse takes you out of comfort zone. management is great -work from home-create schedules around other jobs/school-supply equipment-benefits are generous for the role-despite popular belief, there is lateral and upward mobility optionsthe good thing about working from home for amazon essentially boils down to it being a work from home position with flexible positioning. decent pay, very nice sign on bonus if hiring as an outsider (day one), 10 hr shifts 4 days/week. good benefits. the benefits are pretty decent. you can make a lot of money quickly if you work very hard. amazon is very quickly to spot talent and will develop you and promote you quickly if they see that you are willing to put in a lot of hard work. the work is challenging so you are constantly growing. it was amazing to work here tons of locations to transfer to around the world.full benefits on your first day of employment.relaxed dress code benifiets are very good and monthly bonus great space, fast paced easy money the teamwork, benefits, and staff morale was great. live corporate values,innovative company in interesting industries benefits are good, great co-workers, not a difficult or strenuous job continuous improvement, fast paced, engaging 20 percent off employee discount at macy's and bloomingdales. great pay, great hours, non-rotating, benefits!!! pto,vto,ato, human resources is great. benefits, hours, work place, environment, area great coworkers. played music on overtime days. fun events. fast paced. good pay and good for students it seems like a great company. and it is if you are a customer. most managers have no experience and are also tasked with individual contributor work. so, if you are a manager who also wants to do another whole job at the same time amazon is a great place for you. big name, use it to get a better job, good benefits decent pay, descent benefits. overtime is a constant. you own a part of the company after 2 years in stocks. night shift

people decent pay for part time job with decent benefits 4 days 10 hour shift. good benefits, never lack of work do like the company culture good starting pay with overnight differential, great hours, flexible scheduling, overtime opportunities, lunch break room food options, sometimes a company bonus if the warehouse did great all together for the month. challenging work and amazing colleagues. its blends the fun of working in a start up with benefits of a large company. excellent benefits, great people and environment highly competitive and learning environment.no micro management.great colleagues.many opportunities for trainings. amazon is an amazing place to work. the company is constantly growing furthering career security. full time employees get amazing benefits, time off, and other perks. if you work hard you will go very far as they try to promote from within. the work can be challenging but if you're like me the challenge is always rewarding. most shifts are four 10 hour days allowing you a solid three days to recharge and relax. very interesting and challenging work, i love coming to work every day. hours are extremely flexible as long as you're getting your work done. expectations are high but everyone is super smart and helpful so there are a lot of opportunities for mentorship by senior engineers. so many opportunities no matter your interest- competitive yet collaborative atmosphere and opportunity to stretch and do projects as you please. fast moving and innovative, there is great opportunity to advance skills and career. endless opportunities to

the highest lp jobs out there. young company with outstanding growth possibility. there is never down time. there is always something to do that will have an impact for the customer. the people i work with are incredibly smart and talented and make me better every day. the pay for an entry level position is fairly good. the insurance is through premera blue cross and is excellent. i had better insurance through them than anyone i know. at amazon, no problem is pushed aside as too hard to solve. in fact, they go after the really hard and insolvable problems and then throw talent, time and resources towards solving them. - i was afforded a surprising amount of autonomy as an intern. people rarely necessitated that i do things a specific way (unless they provided sound reasoning as to why it's better than the alternatives). they left many things up to my judgment which was very motivating for me because that allowed the work to be a true reflection of my efforts.- help was absolutely there when i needed it. my team and manager(s) were very welcoming when i visited them with questions or comments.- initiative is welcomed and rewarded with support. if i wanted to take up something that i wasn't expected to do, my manager and co-workers supported me, and my initiative was recognized and rewarded.- extremely high standards which taught me a lot about developing reliable software. now i exercise these standards in every project i take on.- seattle is an amazing city. i have been to many cities around the world and my favorite is seattle. if you like the outdoors, there is a ton of amazing hikes and nature activities. if you like the metropolis life, seattle is very vibrant with a lot of nightlife chances, art shows, music festivals. there is something for every taste in seattle. pushing the limit on building highly scalable, bleeding edge services. employees are focused on the right thing for users and there is a high degree of ownership. you work with some of the smartest people in the industry. my coworkers are supportive and my manager is one of the best manager i've ever worked for. fast paced, time flies, decent money for college kids. good culture. nice ambience. competitive environment. i enjoyed my job while i worked there as i was a picker. if you want to work with international people from different cultures and backgrounds, the best place to work.some people are amazing and have potential to become great friends! you can experience the best work environment ,everyone in the office maintain friendly relations with each other. at the same time you can learn a lot . shares, fun, people, salary, back to education benefit good salary, provides transportation to the employees, infrastructure and facilities at the office are good, good tech support for your laptop. nice place to work. you can learn more if you want very smart people working so this push you to be the best you... good company to work with.good for those

amazon gives you the opportunity to think outside of the box; never bounding you to predetermined decisions. managers have the freedom to solve problems independently but have a team of managers to turn to when in need of second opinions. no two days are the same which creates excitement and new learnings every day. as a company, in many ways, amazon is quite amazing. they've had success in multiple verticals and are continuously expanding into others. if you're working in one of those new verticals, it's exciting to see what will come out of it.people are getting more excited about amazon because they are taking bigger swings (whole foods, online pharmacy, twitch, etc.) from which they have a compelling foundation to build off of (e-commerce) which is different than other big tech companies. the stock has been soaring and general sentiment of financial analysts have been good. the company is continually expanding within seattle, is opening a second hq, and continues to grow internationally. overall, there's always a feeling while working at amazon that something crazy new or exciting is happening somewhere. pay, keeps you busy, relocation, always a new project, diverse benefits and pay competitive pay and flexible hours. we are a very open company that actually lives our leadership principles. i am often amazed at how dedicated people are to their users and

no commute, paid full-time training. this was not an unpleasant company to work for. i was there for 8 years so something must have been good about it. the office culture was mostly great as you were encouraged to be casual, bring your dog to work, and interact with other employees, both on your team and on other teams. i did enjoy that. with the right manager, personal growth was a priority so that was a benefit. time off is excellent, with opportunities for leaves of absence, paid time off, and unpaid time off. pay, for the entry-level warehouse positions, stays about 30% above what area retailers provide, and benefits are good. they include a technical-focused tuition assistance program, company discounts, and stock options.in addition, the company has an open-door policy concerning management, and works hard to provide multiple avenues of communication for their employees. leadership compensation perks and time-off policies your coworkers are generally motivated, capable people. compensation is reasonable, given cost-of-living in the seattle area. lots of good places to eat in south lake union. the pros at amazon are the benefits, stock, and 401k. you can get medical coverage in 30 days. its high deductible but amazon pays 100 percent for you. great pay and overnight gets even more. no experience needed. quick hire on and great training. they are very safety oriented and have on site medical care if you need something or don't feel well during your shift. leadership principles in amazon makes it still work like a start-up by developing leaders in the small teams to own their systems and products. each development team works like its own start-up, each day the developers are encouraged to think big and show ownership. being vocally self critical is highly encouraged and it makes the teams openly identify areas to improve and act upon them. most people are smart and have their own core strengths. the people who stay long are generally seasoned leaders even though they are individual contributors, they look out for mentoring and developing the best.the experience gained working at amazon is valuable. it can be applied at any other start-up/other big/established company which works similar to a start-up effectively. exciting new products putting them into new categories, always looking for new people, you get to work with some great people.

useless projects. everything is used.* a lot of communication between the business side of a project and the tech side.* unique, challenging, and interesting problems to solve (although this could vary depending on which part of amazon)* values aren't just posted on the walls, they're drilled into everything you do* easy to transfer internally to a new job (requires at least a year between

pace environment. great colleagues to learn from and very efficient management. flexible working hours, smart colleagues -no other company will give you experience directly leading up to 500 people as quickly as amazon will, and you will quickly become a leader of people by necessity.-its really interesting to learn what makes the engine of the beast that is amazon fulfillment tick.-working here still looks extremely attractive on the cv, and can provide you with some interesting exit opportunities - even after just one year of employment.-there is scope for quick advancement for exceptionally good performers (promotion to sr. ops mgr within two years, gm within 2.5-4 years, regional director 4-5 years). the merely ‘good’ performers however will get stuck at som and have limited scope to advance beyond.-your sign on package will include a healthy amount of restricted stock units (rsus) that can become very valuable later on if the stock price happens to double or triple - assuming you can stand to last long enough until they fully vest (4 years).-you’ll deal with so many ridiculous situations and individuals that acing the behavioral interview for your next position after you leave amazon will be no problem.-while you’re in the pathways program you’ll get to attend a week long pathways conference in seattle once a year, which is extremely informative, interesting, and actually a ton of fun.-i’m not sure why you would be, but if you’re absolutely, 100% set on working within operations within amazon, the pathways program is a million times better of an entry opportunity than coming in as an area manager or even standard operations manager.-if for some reason you live, breathe, and die for the amazon culture and the amazon way you just might make

good brand,well structured,multiple opportunities, good learning experience share options, associates are great. it is literally incredible what they are doing there. what you hear about the growth and the companies they are doing business with is about 5% of the reality. at aws you really feel you are changing the world for the better.the products are sensational and their meaningful development even more astounding. microsoft is great at marketing machine, but a joke in cloud services. google too (not so good at the marketing, but a joke in cloud services). and those are the two closest competitors. so it's the best time you can have - you are going to customers and selling something that can truly change their entire business and no one else comes close to what you're

means individual members can have a large impact on what the team produces and how their business grows. most of the people you work with are very smart and produce quality work.amazon's business and scale provides has a huge variety of problems to solve (it ranges from building cool web applications, to optimizing order fulfillment and shipping, to personalization, to web services). if you are unhappy with your current team, odds are there is a team elsewhere in the company doing something you find interesting. internal transfers are fairly easy and happen all the time. salaries, freedom of action, responsabilities the great things about amazon are definitely the salary that the company pays its employees and the fact that the company is still young and has lots of market it can still capture. another huge bonus is that they have a downtown office that's right off the i-90 corridor (but that's going to change soon) smart colleagues; impactful platform; great career starting point. smart people, interesting tech, stock awards good pay , quick promotions available i enjoyed the hours and salary here @ amazon. great environment & people to work with! benefits, great co-workers, free coffee benefits, career choice and diversity good salary. if you are looking for quick cash this is the place to work at. you will learn a lot. i learned more about distribution/warehousing

intense, but it pushed me and i had the chance to really make an impact on the fc. you get a lot of responsibility and they trust interns with more than any other company i've heard of. successful completion of this internship will get you extremely far - not only at amazon but also in any interview with another company. the pros to amazon is the benifits. flexible hours great if you in school

staff amazon has really turned around their culture with respecting work-life balance and celebrating wins.some people may not understand that this is a place where there's no \"hand-holding\". if you

and see the impact in the big picture. it’s a great opportunity for me there are no pros working here huge company that sells everything, financially stable. - amazing culture- inspiring people - our

days i loved it. i realized that the management would listen to my ideas and occasionally when i landed on something that would work. they would let me help set it up and get it going. i have never had a company listen to me.i gave everything i had to make our team successful. it usually meant that i was in pain and exhausted by the days end, but i loved to have pride in what i did.i was able to

of smart people. people here are kind and willing to offer help as long as you ask. interesting and challenging problems to solve, good mobility, plenty of opportunity to improve and challenge

facility has a set schedule 99% of the time. cheap benefits that people can afford. industry leaderlong term visiongreat in execution everyone at amazon is smart and fun to work with and do not subscribe to the fud (fear, uncertainty, doubt) that plagues software so big ideas can be followed through on. compensation is generous with a salary, signing bonus, and restricted stock units. hard

opening, you can transfer once every year. steady pay.meeting great people.it's a good workout.you get to see the other side of the online retail industry. there are worse things you can do with a b.a. and knowlege of a foreign language. if you're analytical and you like researching and solving problems, this might work out well for you.some teams of investigators are doing interesting and engaging work. but be aware that other teams are slogging through task after boring task. you want to find out before you start what the work will really entail and particularly how many tasks you will be required to do per hour. in general, the higher the number of investigations per hour, the more routine the work is.colleagues are generally smart and friendly.overtime is usually available if you want it.start times are flexible, so you can come in earlier if you're an early riser or later if you're a late riser.if you don't like how things are going, just wait 5 minutes and it will change. the change may or may not be an improvement, but it will be different. the best reason to work at amazon because its fun to work then and you working with people that care about you and they pay good new warehouse, lots of good jobs, everyone seems to like it - never boring, always learning- in-city location means you aren't forced to live in the god-forsaken suburbs- noone will find your path for you, emphasis on ownership and personal responsibility (this could be a con if you're lazy)- high hiring bar means you're surrounded by people smarter than you massive amounts of

drivers. pay (of course)relaxed dress codemost coworkers are very cool great benefits and decent pay. amazon take care of their employees with fast pace advancement and great benefits. good pay and benefits with multiple jobs within the building and the experience is great on a resume great hours and flexible schedule great people to work with. keep in mind that i don't work at hq in seattle. i work in the fulfillment network and that seems to be a very different environment from hq.-smart people: i work with genuinely intelligent people daily. they bring new perspectives and information. i can honestly say that i've grown professionally.-never a dull moment: the work is always changing. i've struggled with monotony in past jobs, but not at amazon. there is always a new puzzle, project, or question that can be addressed. it makes the day go by fast.-opportunity: amazon is always growing and hiring. new opportunities in almost any role are available.-compensation: the pay here is above average. stock awards are large if you last (most don't).-benefits: the health insurance is very good. additional commentary on benefit sin the cons section.-overall: this is a good place to use as a stepping stone. there is opportunity but you'll shed your fair share of blood and sweat to make the most of it. like all things, some people genuinely love it while others hate it, and people have views that fall everywhere between these two extremes. great starting pay and benefits from day 1, opportunity for career growth if you are motivated benefits, pro , vacation , school the people on my team were great. we sometimes did outings together. availability to move up quickly. decent pay, great benfits, and a very laxed work/life schedule. four day work weeks with three days off.

about amazon was the people you got to work with. the ability to get overtime is the only thing i would say.that and the fact that you work 4 days and get three off back to back. it always was a different smile to come to everyday did have to work as hard. hours was manageable to my everyday life..... work hard. have fun. make history. this really happens every day. endless opportunities to develop one's career, skills whilst discovering different countries overall its a best company for the environment , work culture and flat hierarchy. personally one should be lucky to have a manager who is 100% following the amazon's policy, and you are screwed if the manager bends the rule as he/she wish (though, this happens with most of the organizations in india even though they are world-class, blame is on the people not the company) same applies for amazon. customer service orriented. great place to work at. great companygreat benefitstedious worklow pay compared to their

in the last few years best work culture with balanced life amazon is a place which provides- tremendous opportunities to make an impact- provides authority and responsibility- great place to learn and grow- opportunity to work with lot of super smart people- management style which encourages risk taking and ownershipdisclaimer: i work in tech side of amazon. so above are my observations in tech side of the organization. i do not have visibility into other parts of amazon (say fulfillment, retails etc) very easy to work for - there are literally no limits. you can have an idea, oversee it, and realize it to fruition inside of 6 months.- culture emphasizes clarity and specificity. transparency and straightforwardness are valued above all, and room for bsing is significantly more limited than other large organizations. people communicate in highly literal terms, and the more simple you sound the more well-respected you are. this really is my favorite thing about amazon: there's no reward for garbage consultant lingo that sounds good but is really just hot air. you get to just describe stuff like you would to a 10-year old (in a good way), and you get to say 'i don't know' pretty bluntly when you don't know. that's incredibly rare.- it's easy to move around between teams.- caliber of people around is high. people are significantly smarter than the average in any of the companies i've worked at previously. different galaxy than where (e.g.) microsoft in terms of employee caliber.- you'll learn more than you ever thought possible. a lot of experienced sdes. -fast paced work culture.-you get to work on latest cutting edge technologies.-your opinion matters and will be heard.-great learning curve and enormous growth opportunities.-startup kind of environment in most of the teams.-end to end understanding of the system. - dogs- career opportunities- easy to transfer internally- location- culture isn't \"quirky\" but it is pretty good peoplecutting edge technologyimpact of work you get to work on amazing products at a scale very few will ever get to see.you will get good at interviewing.people follow the amazon leadership principals, and that’s a very good thing! i love the people. i grew to love most of the managers. we just got a much deserved raise. you can easily advance in this company, due to the complexity of the nature of work. you get to work with really smart people who don't slack. benefits, time off, stock, bonus pay great benefits, lots of opportunity for increased pay13.5 per hour can get lots of overtime benefits are excellent, that is one reason many people work it's fairly easy and simple work for the pay. sometimes it can be fast paced but you'll be find once you get into the groove of things. the place had a great culture and is growing so there is a lot of opportunity for young people to move up the ladder. great entry level job with benefits the very first day. relaxed environment, lots of activities easy part time jobflexibleamazon discounts great pay. great benefits! awesome people large company, lots of benefits, you can definitely find good coworkers the company name. attracts great talent and people are intent to learn and make the best of their time and the brand. people are nice and hardworking. compensation (wage--only when non-exempt because of ot; generous stock allotment), a credible company, affordable insurance benefits, 10% discount on items shipped and sold by amazon. they hire alot of veterans and new college graduates. great, innovative company to work for. benefits rock and

provide breakfast and lunch during training. lots more. the cafeteria is nice. being able to work 4 days a week gives you a nice break. it's a job, pay is decent working here is great. things are fast paced, and that can be overwhelming, but at least you're never bored. the medical, dental insurance and healthcare packages are nice. i believe they also have a 401 plan too. opportunity to learn new fields and areas of the business. fair to hourly employees. good opportunities for advancement competitive salary, good benifits, wfh flexibility -seemed like i was surrounded by a lot of top grads and mbas, even in the unsexy vendor management area.-floors i worked on pretty well cleared out by 5:30-6pm, so employees not encouraged to stay late (though some were definitely having to remote in from home after they left, i'm sure).-folks were encouraged to jump around to various departments and job titles to continue their growth.-get to add 'ecommerce' with the world's biggest online retailer to your resume.-lots of room to maneuver and responsibility in your job title-very respectful attitude toward employees. you could 'question authority' for real. actually saw vps show up to team meetings regularly in one dept., and you were expected to ask them difficult questions. and amazon's famous cheapness (yes, they do really use hollow core doors with 4x4s bolted on for desks) extended to vp offices - smack in the middle of the cubicles.

go. there seems to be a sense of who you know for advancement. the hours are very much set for any given shifts. if you are one that wants time off and do not need the money, there is plenty of opportunity for vto which you do not get paid for. however, during the peak season this will not be offered. i like the hours, i get to be home with my kids all day and work here at night. thats it!

adherence to the culture and leadership principles. lots of hours and overtime students and earn cash, you rate numbers are king or you are fired i work for amazon web services (aws), and can only speak to that environment, not the retail side of the business.if you join aws, you'll work with brilliant, driven, a-type personality people. but that means that if you're looking for an easy job, this isn't it. the bar is high and keeps moving up. amazon hires only the best and has a goal to make sure that new hires are better than most current employees. it's not easy to get a job. it's also not easy to keep it. if you don't consistently deliver, don't expect a free ride. but if you're intelligent, motivated, and hard working, you'll love it at amazon.benefits* salary is very competitive, even considering the cost of living in downtown seattle* stock options are great if you stay for 4 years and the stock keeps going up, up, up. when i hired on in august 2016, the stock was $780 per share. in mid-feburary, it's $1450 per share. my shares vest as follows:     * at the end of year 1 = 5%     * at the end of year 2 = 15%     * at 2 years, 6 months = 20%     * at 3 years = 20%     * at 3 years, 6 months = 20%     * at 4 years = 20%* signing bonus is nice. it pays out monthly for the first 2 years.* the health insurance is good for the employee, but expensive for dependents. amazon even pays $500 into your fsa.* maternity leave is paid for 14 weeks.* i work an average of 45 hours per week. the work does ebb and flow with project release cycles.work environment* i work from home 2 days per week. if i have important meetings on those days, i sometimes go into the office anyway.* if you hire on with a good manager, it makes all the difference. that's the same as anywhere, though. there are some good managers and some bad.* amazon overhauled the end-of-year reviews to stop stacking, so any older reviews about that are no longer relevant.* the office atmosphere is pretty relaxed. most people wear jeans and tees. bringing quiet and friendly dogs is encouraged.* the kitchens are okay and stocked with coffee, tea, cocoa, and cider. nothing else.* there is a great ux design team, and everyone digs deep into a project to plan it well.* there is a strong culture for excellence. google the amazon leadership principals to learn more. we use these to hire, to evaluate our peers, and to guide us while we work.* you can move to other teams to find a better fit, and you can grow within your current position. just keep growing. pace at amazon is incredible. we

time goes by quickly. work is through integrity staffing unless hired as a permanent employee by amazon. you are allowed time off without pay after working a few weeks with integrity. very smart people, more than lip service to customers...real customer obsession. the old cliche of only change is constant is very true here. start up culture, great learning, smart people the only reason to work here is that it will improve your future prospects of getting a better job elsewhere. recruiters know that amazon has a high hiring bar and employees are motivated to leave. in rare cases and for rare individuals, you will have the opportunity to build something awesome; for everyone else, it is duct tape and bailing wire to survive christmas. a lot of talented highly skilled peoplenon-trivial

and they have a lot to choose from. starting pay was good and benefits start immediately. great culture. if you want to learn without frills, then this is the place to be. the whole organization is very decentralized with lots of room to try & learn. each team almost works like a start up in itself. great brand in your resume as well. internal tech talks are decent, amazon brand on the resume, great view from the office amazon is a customer centric company, which is always changing. processes improve, associates have ample opportunity to move around and transfer. they also have the opportunity to be promoted in a short time. amazon has fair pay with benefits and we are given stocks every year although they vest after 2 years. it's a fast paced environment with rates for each function. associates are expected to perform multiple tasks, but honestly, there really is nothing difficult about the job. we want our associates to leave the same way they came to work at the end of the day, just a bit more tired. safety is number one followed by quality. if you enjoy an environment that is constant changing and learning about lean manufacturing, then amazon may be for you. we

and grow    - company is a not afraid to take risks if it will provide a fantastic customer experience    - ability to make things happen quickly - if there's something you want to change, go for

about software development. fun, fast paced, friendly environment it's a big name and there is some interesting technology around. but don't expect much. 40 hour work week. possible overtime. good money during peak season. restricted stock units. benefits. 4 day work week. maternity leave is good. met some cool people. no other pros!!! zero, zilch, nada!! so many pros, i'll do this bullet point style so this doesn't get too long:- ability to work from home- flexible schedules, ability to work 4 10 hour shifts and that means a lot of time off (3 days off every week is awesome!)- great work life balance (i know a lot of people say amazon doesn't have this, however i think this is highly dependent on what team you work in and the manager you have, i'm fortunate enough to have both a great team and manager)- pretty good compensation (amazon believes in total compensation, i will go into further details in cons)- learn a ton on the job and have access to the latest and greatest in cloud computing- occasional free food including free breakfast cereals most of the month- lots of very smart people to learn from and collaborate with- opportunity to advance, after working one year you are free to apply for any job in the company...you are really only limited by your own ambition and hard work at amazon.- helping fix customer problems makes me happy, but i might be weird- you are always empowered to fight for and help the customer, which makes it easy to do your job they work with your school schedule if you are a student, summer activities with family members, and it is a very nice/friendly environment to be in. oh and the pay is wonderful, as well as the benefits (health insurance etc.). it's good to be the king. aws is the market leader, but engineering doesn't act like it. extremely innovative and fast paced. if you appreciate the technology it never gets boring to sell it. the people are amazing, and because the hiring process is so daunting odds are most of your peers are solid contributors. great opportunity to make money if you are hungry and resourceful. benefits in healthcare from first day of employment, compensation in vacation hours and personal hours. pay with built in pay raises position including insurance; the people you work with are nice; some of the management is nice others not so much. if you like being in the military you will like this job. the technical challenges and opportunities at amazon are huge. you work with incredibly smart people on incredibly hard problems. you will learn a lot that will help with the rest of your career. amazon has its leadership principles. leadership principle is not only the guide for interviews but also the guide for internal ratings of current employees. this principle demonstrates good company culture. entry level/individual contributors are genuinely good people. high energy, motivated, creative, fun to be around. great cardio workout if you're on the floor. people have been fun and enjoyable for the most part. if you get a blue badge the opportunities are seemingly endless. - office staff was present 24/7- the company was definitely moving to make things better for employees at the time i left- decent hours (i prefer the extra days off to having a shorter workday)- one of the few companies still hiring for general labor while most are/were cutting back money, benefits, fun,

resume. :-) once you're in, there are multiple opportunities to move around, learn new skills, and you can really create your own path up to a point. beautiful campus, beautiful city (seattle). fast paced, work on interesting and complex projects. the computers and equipment were newer. free happy hour on fridays pro's at amazon include great customers and some co-workers. there are lots of very smart, motivated, professional people at this company. working with them can help you raise your game. also, should you be both lucky and smart with your expectations, with the right if timing when joining amazon you can make decent money over their 4 year vesting cycle. thats provided the stock is low enough to see the effort pay off.oh, you can bring your dog to work.i have no regrests for having worked at amazon. i knew what i was signing up for when i joined. amazon had a very competitive internship salary. it also provided a great chance to have ownership over a meaningful project. they were very patient and they always make sure that i get what i need - such as interpreters. the work environment was very laid back. good benefits good pay mandatory overtime great place to build, freedom to be creative work hard, have fun, make history. guaranteed 18 hours pay per week. a few dollars above minimum wage to start - you get to work in an operation that teaches you everything from inbound to outbound.- great pay, compared to other local companies, and the work is rewarding.- management cares about keeping the environment safe and having fun- coworkers are respectful to each other and there is a strong sense of teamwork.- plenty of opportunity for overtime or even voluntary time off, when available. this was my first job out of college, amazon often takes newer people and helps them grow.i learned way more on my first few years on the job than in school.decent wage and benefits.there are a lot of smart people in aws i've been at amazon for about four months now. it is a great place to work. clean, organized and very safety conscious. there is work to be done and they pay, in my opinion, very well for the work/tasks to be performed in each job description. if you have a decent work ethic, you will probably feel the same way about working at amazon as i do. no place of employment is perfect. i was hired on direct, full-time with amazon. i received a bank of paid time off, unpaid time off and paid vacation time when i started. within 30 days, the option for medical, dental and other benefits. also investment options. i still have some pay raises to look forward to and i believe i will top out at about $14 an hour in my current position. want to move up the corporate ladder? talk. communicate with the appropriate staff about a program to set you up on that path. our leaders or supervisors are called, \"ambassadors\". among other tasks they perform is cheerleading and supporting the workers to help make the job we do more enjoyable. let's make it fun. at least as fun as possible. i've never been anywhere else where that is any significant priority. get to learn the ins and outs about the company. great associates, fun team and entreprenuerial environment. * smart people, especially on the front lines and in line management* cool problems* relatively high level of autonomy, transparency* values scrappiness, data savvy* relatively less organizational politics than places of similar size* great place to be a woman in early career; i am assessed based on my capabilities far more than my gender. this may not be as true in the fcs as it is in corporate hq.* jeff b, for all his lack of empathy on twitter, is a brilliant business leader and refuses to let the organization get complacent or over-bureaucratic. that's a tendency of large organizations and he checks it and pushes jeff w to correct for it much faster than other leaders. i fundamentally deeply trust his ability to keep us on track. you are the true owner of your career here. even if you were not placed in a level you may have expected. you always have the opportunity to take steps in getting yourself there. great benefits, every day is different and great people to work with - respectful culture- great work environment (clean, spacious)- everybody is held to the same high standards- excellent pay and benefits - transportation benefits were a surprise- many development opportunities- creativity is encouraged- treated as an adult- diverse- customer obsession, innovation, large scale, freedom to try new things, and acceptance (and celebration) of mistakes super smart people, great campus, good extracurricular activities/speakers, lots of ownership, always learning, easy to switch teams work with some of the best minds in the industry 10 hour days. no micro managing. paid a fair wage for the work. great benefits if you were to stay a long time. large company with a lot of room to move flexible hrs , good for lazy people cutting edge company, rapid software development the company pays good. and you get great benefits that start day one of employment. they also give you restricted stock options. good pay and you keep busy all the time work is easy. nothing else good one of the best things about working at amazon (especially aws) is that the scale creates really interesting problems for software engineers, it's very motivating to see academic problems in daily basis. there are really smart people around and culture is very open and encouraging people to learn from each other. every aws product is an art of engineering, it's an excellent chance to get to know behind the scene. teams are independent and can iterate really fast, every engineer partakes the decision of what to do next. there's almost zero bureaucracy. it's great to be responsible for operations of the software, being oncall adds another dimension to software engineers. they really try hard but culture is now pc like most places. worked rush and peak at christmas time and not once heard any holiday music at all throughout the facility. continuous learning.lot of growth opportunities.space to excel your skills.easy team change opportunity. below average, redundant work.paid vending machines.biased mediocre managers. stock options are very attractive now startup environmentlot of challenges to seekstock prices always increasing the only thing good about this company is that it hires literally everyone so if you are in bad need of a job just apply and you got a job. 1. good place to start your career.2. senior sde will teach you a lot.3. you can go whatever team you like. good to grow and much to do and learn. large company, with a lot of potential to grow and immense resources. great experience for a college student its a new innovative company that is constantly growing, so always something new. it a trendy work environment with all the typical tech bells and whistles. great place and fast paced environment. great leadership and very entrepreneurial you get to learn a lot.your code goes into production very soon and often and you feel you are accomplishing something.lot of smart people around you. good teamwork may be a little confusing for the new joinees i have worked for amazon in operations for nearly 7 years and while it has not always been easy, it has been an overall great experience and i would strongly recommend it to anyone who is willing to put in the effort. amazon managers work hard and are held to high expectations which simply is not for everyone. for me personally, i have loved being surrounded by highly intelligent people who have a great work ethic and who care passionately about taking care of customers and contributing to the success of the organization so i actually prefer the fact that we demand a lot of managers and in doing so we end up with very high quality managers. one of the best things about the company is how empowered managers are to make a difference and have an enormous impact. overall it's hard to beat amazon in terms of a fun company to work for that will push you to grow and provide you with awesome opportunities. anyone who can get through the tough hiring process is crazy not to take a job with amazon as long as you're willing to work and not simply looking for an easy paycheck. smart peoplenever a day when i don’t learn something

benefits are not bad. management is good and easy to talk to and appreciative you your work. its possible to work up to 29 hours a week as a part time employee, if you take extra shifts via their online site. great place to work so far.. i work an overnight shift thur-sat at 12 hours per shift. i was there for one week and advanced as to a problem solver position with the same pay, but progress is available moving forward. so far management has treated me with respect and answered any questions that i have had. the work can be redundant, but the benefits are amazing. and the pay is

principles which every amazonian imbibes on their behavior- easy internal team movements (if you match the criteria) get to know good people none at this time. maybe will provide info later there are no real pros to talk about great benefits, pto and vacation from day one the only pros are the pay and benefits. good pay and have a company vehicle. - work with smart, passionate, diverse people- huge company, be up close to so much innovation- decent benefits, good pay good benefits, flexible hours, holiday pay. 10% discount. can meet people globally working virtually. amazon is a global brand. having it on your resume is a plus. -amazon will push you to your limits plus more-you get paid very well and the benefits are great-if you’re willing to move around the potential for growth is pretty high. however if you’re not it’s pretty political to get promoted and i’ve heard it’s easier to leave the company and come back and apply for a higher level position.-the pay was so good that we were able to accomplish some financial goals that we would not of accomplished if i did not work for amazon many different teams to explore, motivating coworkers, plenty of opportunities for growth great people and great culture great benefits, open culture, very lgbtq friendly. global company. your designs will get seen by millions, not thousands, of people. tons of potential for advancement if you're the type to get out and climb the corporate ladder. 40 hours a week, constant overtime opportunities, flexible schedule, managers are easy to talk to i would not have been able to learn as much as i did anywhere else. good money and good benifits i love amazon!! they have great benefits, great hours, great opportunities for moving up with the company and even not with the company!! ( career choice) they have a great hr team!! have opportunity to learn and build systems. weight loss, benefits from day 1, steady work, vendor coins, bna bucks, everything is online, no \"real\" dress code, free safety gear set schedule, 3 days off, always work salary, and lots of opportunities to move up or transfer huge potential to learn quickly in an environment where there is less politics and more focus on getting things done for amazon and where you are treated more for your skills than politics multiple tools for choice, especially aws service there are a lot of interesting projects and teams at amazon, and there is a lot of opportunity to work on things that you care about. it's very team dependent though, as each team has its own personality and work culture.there's a lot of opportunities for you to own your project and make it succeed. your team also encourages you to ask questions often so that you can excel on your project and learn more about the company.work-life balance was decent, and there weren't too many times i had to stay insanely late in the office. again, this will be team dependent, and a few of my friends had to work extremely late to finish their project.there are also intern events throughout the summer, though not as elaborate as the ones from microsoft or google. you're in charge of finding your own friendships and groups as well. unlimited growth potential. good pay and benefits decent entry level pay continually learning every day. work with smart people who are customer obsessed. invest time in researching and applying new technologies. quick promotions. work process is adaptive so you can do different things. shift transfers. assistance with going to school good pay, 4 days a week unless you have overtime and no dresscode, its it's always casual smart coworkers , great campus , salary and benefits.i have never been at a company who allowed such fast realization of ideas. bring your idea well documented with supporting data and your are off to the races. this company experiments, puts customers first and creates true innovation and value. smart people, cutting-edge use of technology. massive scaling and global expansion challenges. real world experience, good amount of responsibility given as an intern fun, face paced. covered most distribution activities with one job title so lots of experience. lots of overtime. works around your schedule very challenging work, work with extremely bright people, tons of ownership, very fast paced. very interesting or problems, highly motivated people working with really smart, motivated people is amazing and that's exactly what you'll get here. you'll be challenged every day: going above and beyond is part of the norm here. people around you are very goodalmost no bureaucracytons of learningpassionate and motivated people will prosper here great place to learn a lot at a fast pace great pay and flexible schedule * the culture of software engineer ownership of amazon's offerings - i have repeatedly pitched ideas which amazon funded two-pizza teams for to pursue* general engineering culture - it is *expected* that you have your own ideas and push back politely and with data in hand if you are asked to do something that you think is not the optimal thing to do right now - yes, even as a software engineer intern (this leaves some interns slack-jawed, from other employers i guess they sometimes expect that someone will tell them exactly what to do how)* amazon (most certainly amazon web service) expects and rewards engineering and operational excellence (stuff i happen to love and specialize in) - and has such scale that it is a top (the top?) place to work to drive engineering excellence at a giant scale* amazon has world-class executive management - in the amazon web service space i know and can vouch for pretty much every vice president or higher - execs here are deeply technical while also focusing on employee happiness and career path, and typically have big actionable vision for the future, too. yes, really. working here is challenging, progressive, and cutting edge. you work on new projects, deploy new technologies, develop new code, and support great innovative products. the people and teams you interact with are smart, focused, and as professional as in any company i have worked for - with a lot less politics, and a lot more productivity. they like facts, encourage healthy discussion, and build trust in you as a direct contributor to the company's success. lots of responsibly. room to grow. there are only two good things about this horrible company. first the benefits are great. second, opportunity to make above minimum wage is a plus. 1. tremendous growth opportunities as company is on growth path2. if someone wants to learn, try out new things then this is the company you want to work with. it is not the place where you can get away without performing3. stringent selection process keep the quality of employees high which in turn brings great work culture4. very healthy relocation package is offered for new joiner5. excellent transportation benefits in seattle area weekly pay, flexible hours, location a very exciting and empowering place to work. innovation is king, especially at amazon web services. shift bonuses laid back supervisors i came into amazon as a university programs hire. i have had amazon opportunities to work on things at a level that i never imagined. career development and growth within my first year have been beyond what i could have expected. nice starting pay. you can earn bonuses. they do have 401 k and stock bonuses as well. i can work from home, but not everyone gets that option. they offer work from home, they pay nicely, they offer great benefits, room for advancement. - amenities, buildings, location- pay, the people you work with pay is competitive with other tech companies. there are many opportunities to grow with the company and they like crazy ideas and embrace difference so it never feels stiff to work there. there is monthly profit sharing, yearly stock and benefits on day one. - amazon is going to teach you how to be the best at what you do. the caveat there, however, is that it can be difficult to learn more than just that unless you make yourself a slave to your job. favorites tend to be cherry-picked by managers and given extra opportunities to be promoted.- the people that you work with are very smart, but many will step on each other to get ahead.- parking reimbursement is a definite plus- fishbowls (music/author/actor) events are very fun- internal transfer process can help with personal growth and development, but expect to own that process! interesting work, great people, lots of autonomy and flexibility the days go by fast and never boring. the pay is great and the people are very nice. they care about their people and will help you succeed in everything you do. it can be fun, rushing about, trying to cope with a never-ending tsunami of boxes, and working to create a sense of \"team\". if you work as a picker or stower, this job can give you a great workout. the people are mostly very friendly and approachable and it is customary to engage in a little chit-chat in order to maintain sanity. full-time permanent employees get lots of chances to take time off including paid time and the dress code is very liberal. great work environmentjobs is generally easyif help is needed it will be provideda lot of growth opportunities less salary..... managers team lead perks and atmosphere are very positive great learning curve for software developers. - flexible hours- good pay flexible work hours, work from home allowed, great culture of friendliness and transparency. 1) you can learn lot of new things.2) they have the best mentors3) good salary marketing division- interesting work- great career opportunities- agile environment- individual ownership of tasks- flexibility and ability to enable change- global information sharing- very data driven and led a very flexible work environment good and easy.first is jam then versant test on english its a fantastic organization with huge opportunities for personal growth. amazon really cares about the development of its people. if you ask, you'll get one or more great mentors. - challenging environment with attainable goals- ability to innovate and drive your ideas- tons of ownership with projects and within your role- culture is top notch- work/life balance is right where i need it to be very high standards, very fast-paced with much work to do. numerous internal opportunity; relevant work for business; close partnership with all relevant leaders - always striving for best- learn a lot and look for best industry practices- highly knowledgeable peers- senior management is in details and industry recognized professionals amazon is a place that does not slow down. we invest in growth and have found a lot of success, which is something to be proud of. you also do not often run into situations where good ideas are not given a fair hearing and/or resources to mature. only a few months in but so far i have stayed surprised at the time provided new employees to ramp up and take training courses specific to many of the aws services. nowadays, companies hire you and throw you at the work, aws takes an approach where for each employee to be able to be in front of customers and be the expert, they take the time to train you as such. my team, manager, and up stream management have all been great. compensation, stock options, competitive work environment, personal development & growth. fun, rewarding, and challenging environment + probably the most innovative tech company out there today. it's impossible to be bored here+ lots of career growth opportunities due to the incredible expansion of the business+ work culture has significantly gotten better since the nyt article in 2015 and a change in the svp of hr. examples include paid maternity/paternity leave, flexible hour teams, fairer employee review system etc. manageable work-life balance, entrepreneurial culture, fail fast but learn and move on, nice people. benefits are really really awesome pay is good until you realize you make the same as the lazy idiots you work with. healthcare from day one is nice. the do provide some vacation and paid time off although you will use it quickly when they schedule mandatory overtime. direct hire process is fast and easy assuming you can read, pass a background and drug test. however i have met people who i am not sure can read, or speak english and with criminal and drug history, go figure. flexible working hours, awesome work environment pay. benefits. great refresher on hr skills. meet great people.fast paced. great benefitsadvancement without bachelors degreemonthly attendance bonus people really seem to get along, at least that was how it was at sat2 in san marcos.

best place for you. great work at home job, with options for chat or phone. they also allow you to edit your schedule based on your need and allow you to take time off if it can be approved. ever-changing, always something new to do or learn. pays bi-weekly on timenice cafeteriagood benefit (health care, dental)easy to get in (only back ground check)a lot of young workers. cool and

great place to work at any level. i was an intern here. people around you are very talented and help you a lot. no office politics. good company to work with. best work culture. no dress code. you will get an opportunity with amazing talented people. at amazon, one feels at home. it isn't taxing, it's like you're getting paid to be yourself! a kind staff; healthy company! i joined amazon in 2009 and have thoroughly enjoyed my time since then. what strikes me most about amazon is how meritocratic it is, everyone is judged based on their quality of work and intellectual capability, not

expectations, including insurance & a 401k plan.-semi-casual workplace environment. generally speaking, amazon has a lax dress code, focused more on workplace safety than on aesthetics. casual attire is allowed and expected, so most anything you'd wear to a public outing you could come into work wearing.-lgbt-friendly. amazon will not base decisions regarding employment or promotion on your sexuality or gender, and also have programs in place to support the social and financial aspects of a person looking to transition. great work good atmosphere i like it great growth opportunities and

culture, chill environment, chill dress code, company subsidized café with organic food, respectful co workers \"a month at amazon is like a year elsewhere\" is the standing joke. you learn more than

four day work week. great communication and integrity, unlimited opportunities amazon is great company if you like the fast paced environment. company tend to focus on what really matters and that is customer experience. people are solution oriented more than problem focused. they legitimately want to remain number 1 in the industry. if job security is important to you, then you definitely want to work with people who have a clue. their is a healthy paranoia around staying number 1 and targeting seemingly unachievable goals (but somehow always achieving them). strong teammates, cutting edge technology, and you learn a lot seemingly endless headroom for advancment. the culture is remarkable here - this is a company that truly abides by its leadership principles. two in particular stand out. customer obsession: if you believe that building great products and businesses starts by understanding the customer and committing to solve their goals, you will fit in well. ownership: if you do your best work when you feel like a business owner and want to have the freedom to dive in, you will fit in well. if you don't match up with either of these statements, you won't succeed. the company really is obsessed with the customer. there are a lot of really challenging projects inside the company that are a blast to work on and you get to be around a lot of really intelligent people. if you become a \"blue badge\" the benefits are pretty decent. you get excellent medical/dental/vision for an affordable cost, and you receive rsus (restricted stock units) which vest after 2.5+ years. you

arrears)plenty of overtime availablefree, unlimited hot drinksfree transport (from mcr airport) infrastructure, facilities, work is excellent, state of art technology good money, and if you became a blue badge it'll be easier good career prospect, well settled and awesome work environment. i am glad to be part of my team. here, people are ambitious. i found friendly environment to create bias for actions to achieve workplace goals. mainly,management principles helps you to reach heights in workplace as well as in your personal life. if you have fine talent you will definitely be encouraged. flexible work place and its still day one and every day its new learning customers are truly in the center of the thought process for any change. fast moving. opportunities to grow are plentiful, promotions are truly based on your performance rather than your network. the recruitment process is pretty good (haven't seen anything better), the company & its employees does not get complacent, because the promotion process is based on facts rather than politics, the collaboration between staff is much healthier than in other it companies. i like the fact that employee can get substantial rsus (makes you feel part of the company. for any changes, you need to document your proposal in writing which really forces you to be thorough and actually helps you in finding better ideas thru the process. it is easy to find volunteers to help you on projects. you will be the one managing you work-life balance. it is up to you to put a limit. however, it is possible to find the right balance and be successful. although there are a few cons, the pros over weight them massively in my opinion. i am delighted i moved to amazon. decent benefits if you get hired onvery clean and safety oriented warehouse good pay,medical insurance, free transportation 1) the status or position discrimination,2)no uniform -> no curtailment,3) no possessions -> dynamic sitting the floor is yours,4) festive

learn,amazing peaks ,salary is also good. really enjoyed working in this company innovative business model, exciting and enthusiastic managers. opportunity for promotion (for the right people). strong returns for 401k investment, stock sharing program year 1: 90k base salary, 25k bonus, 10k relocation pay.year 2-4: 90k base salary (barring a raise), mix of bonus/stock to average out at ~110k yearly compensation.healthcare is good, dental is good. money is decent for the seattle area. not outrageously good and not bad.i work ~40 hours a week and am happy with my work-life balance, but i can definitely see how there is potential for a horrible time. everything is so team dependent here.i'd advise any potential hires to take this job if it's the best offer you have, but if you're stuck

surrounded by brilliant minds; no matter your vertical, it is guaranteed that you will meet peers who truly raise the bar. they trust you with a lot of responsibility that you will find no where else. in some cases, you will manage over 100 associates by the end of the 10 week internship. this is incredibly stressful, but any job will be stressful that gives you that much experience. you learn things you would learn in no other place and gain valuable experience and knowledge. you also only work 4 days a week which is nice.if hired full-time, there is a lot more flexibility as far as where

it depends what are you are assigned to, also an amazon fulfillment center is a warehouse ruled by kaizen & six sigma ideologies for those who know what i am talking about it will be no surprise to find that productivity and zero tolerance for defects is an everyday thing. management has productivity goals to meet efficiently and at the lowest cost so be ready to work as a machine, think of yourself as a piece of machinery they could not yet create to perform the same task over and over for 9 or more hours on your feet with a productivity goal to meet per hour.- you'll never be sent home against your will for lack of work- you work 4 days a week 10 hours each day which could be an advantage for some- unpaid and paid time from day 1- full benefits from day 1- climate controlled warehouse (you'll see it is not ac though).- overtime pays time and a half- tasks assigned are simple to understand- 30 minute lunch break the money is good and paid weekly. they offer a competitive wage. they also offer school accomodation which is great. great benefits, lots of ot, awesome co-workers work at amazon flows at lightning speed! i am constantly surrounded by super smart people. you are constantly challenged to innovate and come up with more efficient processes. 1. great place to learn.2. great colleagues. all of the benefits are great flexible schedule, work from home, easy job this is the place to be. good payemployees are chillcan't think of anything else that's a pro so i'll repeat myself with saying that the pay is good lots of opportunities to work on different interesting projects and teams.relatively good emphasis on best engineering practices and bar.new teams constantly cropping up and looking for engineers. good hours and lots of overtime -easy hiring process.-the opportunities for employee feedback seemed promising. did not see many implemented.-voluntary time off offered.-starting rate was decent for the area, especially with a benefits package offered.-vacation time/unpaid time was readily available from day 1 to be used when needed.-casual dress code. i had to make sure i was stowing at all time huge company that has expanded to so many markets and areas and the potential for growth is massive and would like to stay with this company as they take over the world bright, hardworking, and kind people. big projects. true to principles. encouraged to take ownership of personal workload, co-workers are top notch. the ability to grow a career or further a career. amazon has something for everyone!! the number one pro of working at amazon are the benefits. you won't find another company that has better benefits than amazon does. they are plentiful, and you will spend your first few months \"uncovering\" benefits you weren't initially told about. the culture here is well above par from what i expected coming in. it puts the culture at most of my past jobs to shame. work life balancesupportive leadership, who are willing to help create/direct the roadway for your future career goals.everyday presents new challenges one of the first pieces of advice i read here before joining was that you have to be \"self-directed\", in that work here can be very uncertain and you have to figure out a lot of things on your own. some people see this as a negative. however, i believe that the unpredictability and the pressure to uniquely find a solution no one else has found can be quite empowering. one of the leadership principles here is ownership, and it is one that can guide you to a very fulfilling career, where you learn new stuff every day for many years. sure, it can be intimidating and overwhelming for even very experienced technologists. but if you are clear on your purpose and career goals, and the impact you can make on others, you can be energized every day by these challenges. it's a very unique culture, and it is by no means ideal or perfect, but in the world of inventors, it's not supposed to be. amazon is a big company that lets you work in many different areas with potentially many different problem spaces. the intern requirements were not too strict. great peers, flexibility, opportunities to grow - great working culture-approachable higher management-scope of growth is there if you are ready to commit more than 3-4 yrs at a site a friendly environment to work, with lots of fun at wok place. fun work culture.chilled out work ethics.allowed to wear casual clothes.fun activities and outings. benefits, work culture and good learning phase for freshers. decent salary, good shifts, good

for amazon. this job works well for me as a part-time warehouse associate. i have a set schedule with part-time flexible hours. it's always busy and your learning, moving at a very fast pace which in turn makes the work hours fly b quickly. high sign-on fee, it is a pretty good thing great benefits, nice working environment had really cool ereader products fast-paced environment where those with strong work ethic can thirve if you are self-motivated, there is opportunity for career development. you work with some very intelligent people. compensation is fair. they pay above average salary but it is all just a trap to get you to sign on to the company. don't fall for it. no amount of money is worth the horrible experience you will have working at myhabit. open environment. constant innovation. smart people. good stock plan for managers. growth opportunity available through relocating. greate poeple and challenging tasks very intelligent people who work here and have a lot on their plate. everyone is always busy and if you wanted to, you could work for 24 hours a day. compensation is really goodleadership principles the opportunities are possible and endless pto, vacation time, health insurance, 401k, organized workplace, clean warehouse the pay is good. you meet a lot of people. there is always something to do or learn. there are plenty of shift days/times. you will definitely get some type of workout. good pay, awesome team of mostly former bankers or ex-big4 there was a lot to like. the work is interesting, there's a lot of smart people, and i learned a lot. if this is your first job out of college and you want to work a lot, then great. if you have a family, don't work here. -smart coworkers-decent pay and location-always learning something new good pay, plenty of hours, and easy to get promoted. leading the market in innovation and constantly finding ways to bring savings and value to our customers. there are a lot of very bright people here that think out of the box to create value both short and long term. it's exciting to work for a company that truly has unlimited potential both today, and many years down the road. people here are relentless are driving internal cost savings that deliver value to our customers. on the flip side, others are relentless at finding new streams of cash by identifying underserved market segments or identifying completely new segments. it is invigorating being part of a very unique company. cool company that offers a great service. good work/life balance. good comp. learn a lot about the mindset needed to run a business effectively - more than you can learn at most other companies good compensation, interesting projects, a lot of opportunities within a company it's just great to be here, a company filled with people with good work ethics good compensation package, millions of customers, some very interesting technologies especially in the area of distributed computing, some interesting talks, aws teams seem to be the best organized with the highest level of morale you get to 'own' what you work on - no one will come rescue you. so you'd better be on top of things the salary is enough high in the old days (1995-2002), the people who worked here were incredibly smart, talented, interesting, versatile. i have never worked with a smarter group. ever. it was like being in an elite college--that level of intelligence, but in a work environment. very fun and stimulating. amazon is an excellent place to work if you are driven and enjoy a fast paced and rewarding career with excellent upside potential. i like it how performance is rewarded with increased responsibiliites and stock based awards. the company is truely customer centric and is continuing to strive toward a better customer experience in all aspects. competitive work environment and great team dynamic environmentsteep learning curvevariety of responsibilitiesopportunity for innovationintelligent

obsession drives everything. world wide opportunities if you are willing to evolve. no dress codeeasy worklax environment the benefits are great and half the price of my husband's who works for a large ambulance company. all the supervisors are kind, helpful, understanding and compassionate. i started working for a brand new center at its opening and add long as you paid attention the work is simple to understand. i got ill and had to take a leave of absence. hr was very helpful in explaining how to do it and what i was entitled to before calling. i ended up needing surgery and easily turned my personal leave into a medical leave with a phone call. i filled out the paperwork and my doctor faxed it back. i had no problems returning to work when my leave was over. they give you a bonus every month you don't use your unpaid time. the company cares for those even at the lowest level. i am currently an l1 and have had opportunities that i would not have imagined with people higher up in the company. i am grateful for everything that amazon has sent my way. the hours are great and the staff and managers allows relatively easy movement across teams or even geographies.

atmosphere great place for advancement. education opportunities and growth. good company, benefits. fun and friendly managment keeps you challenged everyday , great learning there are a bazillion different projects to work on, and 95% of them are solving interesting, difficult software engineering problems. compensation package is great. what i like best though is that everyone here is smart and motivated. almost no slackers. everyone is talented and (at least on my floor) works hard. obviously it's a huge company, so my experience is just a small sample, but i'd recommend you give it a shot. just be prepared for the rigorous computer-science-heavy technical interview. a little preparation is all it takes - there are books available on interview prep that cover all aspects of what to expect... great people and great pay for an individual working on a college degree. the people here really care about safety and our benefits are amazing. - empowered and smart employees. \"fueling\" smart people that raise the levels of thinking of those around them- the culture is not about turf, culture is genuinely about solving problems for customers and anticipating future customer needs. so much so we don't need the customer obsession leadership principle on the wall, it is part of our dna. how we assess, how we speak, how we promote, and how we performance manage etc.- high hiring bar to keep the first bullet above current - working with exceptionally talented, experienced game developers on games that push the envelope in some aspect. think big is taken seriously.- feels like a small to mid-size studio, but with backing of a huge corporate parent with resources.- i'm excited to go to work every day.- people that don't belong there are moved out. i want to work with a strong

10 hours 4 days a week. wiyb 3 days off!!! when you venture into a job with amazon, you are likely not going to be prepared for what you experience. amazon is a place where you will have very challenging work for a very good cause, customer experience. i have a career of working in the customer service business and i've learned more and achieved more in my time with amazon than with any other organization.people are passionate about the work which does result in sometimes heated conversations, but those conversations are all grounded on one thing, \"what is the best experience for customers?\" it is refreshing to go into discussions with this same grounding as it enables you to walk out of the room and know the debate was not personal towards an individual, but focused on doing the right thing for our customers.i also appreciate the focus on excellence in written communication. i have learned even more about the power of the written word than i knew coming into the company. by applying your focus to writing a document, you enable a clarity of thought that isn't seen through power point. writing in a narrative format forces you to think critically about your proposal or update and forces you to think about the questions that others will have on your document. while it may be a painful adjustment in the beginning, you will quickly realize the value and will never want to go back!the last big pro to working at amazon is that you never know what's going to happen next. in my time with the company i've seen us grow from a retailer to disruptor in the reading industry

becoming a bigger part of the digital ecosystem while also challenging conventional thoughts about any industry. good growth and good ownership overall everything you look for in a company. just apply

overall i love working for amazon. in general i get to work on interesting problems and the experience i am getting here will transfer well to anywhere i choose to go. cloud computing ftw! i'm a career software developer, so my review will be slanted toward the environment amazon provides for engineers. i can't speak to what it's like to work in the operations, retail or other areas of the company.the single best reason to work here is that amazon has done a good job hiring smart people. i'm surrounded by people with a variety of different talents, whether it's design skills, algorithms knowledge or general programming skills. i am consistently stretched in my development by being exposed to different, intelligent viewpoints. that's mixture of dna is vital to a thriving environment where people continue to learn and stay engaged.one of amazon's other key strengths is its ability to remain focused on customers and building long-term value. i've worked here for over 10 years, and we've consistently found innovative ways to improve the experience for customers. many projects don't reap immediate profit or cost savings rewards, but because they're the right long-term move for the company, we do them anyway. that's great to see as a long-term employee. i work for amazon web services, which is definitely the hot spot in the company. great game-changing technology that is shaking up the industry. absolutely no complaints about what we are doing. you get to work on challenging problems and learn from some of the best engineers out there. there also tends to be a clear correlation between what you're working on and tangible business objectives. also, individual development groups have a lot of autonomy in how they work. (this has it's downsides; see below.) amazon is a great company in many respects -- the core retail website and amazon's customer service operations are outstanding. given it's established status as a successful online retailer, it's in an advantageous position to sell digital media which will of course become an increasingly huge market. the company also has an extremely driven, hands-on, engaged ceo. entrepreneurial environment still exists which makes your job interesting. there is little time for micro-managing of employees - people who last and succeed at amazon.com loves this aspect. the company's stock performance has been very strong which makes the low salary ranges easier to deal with during reviews. there is still a lot of \"out of the box\" thinking when tackling problems. there is accountability within all levels of the company. smart people and fun, casual environment where you are given tremendous responsibility from day 1 very litle politics. if i do a good job, i get recognized. things happen very quickly here - there is little red tape/beauracracy and people tell each other the truth. amazon has a lot of interesting projects going on at any given time. you will likely be dealing with projects that have a scale that few other companies can compete with. this will well prepare you for your next job.if you're interested in a project that you are not working on you can still access the code and explore the development environments. this helps when starting a new project so that you can see how others have done things before.amazon tries to hire smart people, this means that you will likely be surrounded by people that will be able to teach you something. career opportunites and advancement are available for those who are willing to work hard it's okay to work when you single i love to work in a fast pace environment like amazon. it is also very challenging cause we have to keep up with a certain speed and time. they also offer u benefits. amazing benefits for all employees, very spoiled 4 day workweek; very flexible paid time off & unpaid time off; school accommodation with your scheduled shift. hr is great, and respond rapidly to associate questions, concerns, or situations. work from home, flexible schedule, decent pay, great support work at company that is known and growingfast paced and not boringlearn many things rather quickly good money for no experience and immediately getting hired without an interview process great people to work with and you will always be busy with the amount of work given to you. they are very good to work for motivating and great benefits plenty of training, fun team to work with, great benefits, lots of opportunity for overtime, growth and promotion is highly encouraged. good company to work for.always get to learn new things great pay awesome training benefits, pay. amazon is a good chance for hardworking people to make decent pay and great benefits. its up to you whether you want feel completely alone, or interact with others in the workplace. if you go into the job with the right attitude everyday its really not that bad. great for those who need a quick job to get back on their feet during a transitional phase.. competitive environment, constant feedback from management, huge amounts of learning and experience gained in very short time frames. great benefits: time-off, healthcare, incentives, etc. smart and motivated people at the company, with most believing truly that they are innovating and bringing new life to experiences to customers. although pay structure a bit complicated, it is a good, fair scale. i at least get paid weekly. extremely intelligent co-workers. lots of cool technology. lots of work time goes by fast, fun activities, dj lunches ice cream vending machine, ping pong table, and lots more the managers and recruiters are really active and energetic. decentralised management structure allows for creativity, ownership and freedom. the

developmentopportunities for learning and improvementgood for goals-driven peoplepersonal support i like to work in amazon because its a big corporate company. most popular in a world there are constant challenges, driven by the customer obsession culture. we really strive to deliver the best thing for our customers. tnohe people that i work with are team players, very smart, some of them

a common goal: customer experience. razor sharp focus means lazy, useless people usually can't hide and are fast fired compared to other places. great place to learn and pick up new work responsibilities - because there are so much growth it means if you are capable, they are more than happy to throw more work at you (but dont expect to be paid for it). i still occassionally miss the constant high quality/caliber of smart + capable + dedicated people that are everywhere at this company - it is really rare elsewhere. i compare amazon to the bains/bcgs/mckinseys of the hightech work enviorment. with the growth the company is undergoing, there will be continual growth/promotional opportunities for the next decade. the general public's confidence in making online purchases will only increase as the \"text\" generation graduates from college and has access to disposable income. good place to work at. super engineering talent, combined with visionary leadership and a customer

you will work with some of the brightest engineers out there.the total compensation is nice. do not flinch at having part of your compensation be rsus. even if stock price goes down, your compensation will be adjusted. because amazon sees rsu as part of the compensation, they will fix it with market fluctuations. there really is only upside. no, you won't retire on rsu....won't buy a house....maybe a nice car is stock goes through the roof. the pay at amazon is very fair stock keeps going up :)get to learn a lot from team mates.great managers (for the most part)you can take on as much

working hours i had a really good team of managers that gave me tons of guidance from inbound direct functions, workers comp is decent, you really learn a lot if you are a new grad. aws do have some

live, if you need some money they will have alot of work for you.i now no what boot camp is like. if your make friends with the production assistants or area managers, your time there will not be as bad. i really enjoyed their training- it was hands-on, and was created with retention in mind, using a number of different educational approaches meant to work for all learning styles. they had great support for their csas, including great trainers and supervisors, excellent online tools, chat programs and online tutorials. - as long as you do what is expected of you, you are generally left alone and you can fly under the radar if so desired- benefits are decent (but expensive with high co-pays) good pay and nice hours speed of doing stufflack of bureaucracycareer growthinsanely smart peopleno bs environment. no politics part time guarantee if you show up and need to work there it keeps you going motivated and you're always doing something you're never bored or busy fellow associates were great to work with. everyone gets along. job is fairly easy if you communicate with your peers. lots of overtime during peak holiday season. great work environment, pays well with and plenty of of overtime if needed. extremely smart people. plenty of autonomy. ability to grow and take on a lot of responsibility. i get to work from home and most of the time it is actually fun. a lot of walking to burn calories.if you're one of the rare hard working employees, your work is appreciated. when they say \"good job,\" they will actually mean it.everyone's work is over-rated, so if you're mediocre, management will tell you that you're good. if you're good, you'll be told that you're great. nice for the ego, i guess, and it also means that it doesn't take much effort to get recognition and feel secure in your job.there are people of all shapes and sizes and ages, and they're all getting by, so there's no need to worry if you think you can't do it because you're too old/too fat/no experience/etc. you can definitely do it. i've met multiple 70+ year old women, and they all get the job done! i'd personally prefer the job to be more grueling because of my weight-loss goals, but i'm still losing weight, so i can't complain too much.you can choose your shifts, and you'll get those shifts every week with no boss telling you, \"you have to come in this saturday.\" if it turns out that the shifts you chose are no good for you anymore, you can get on your computer, select a new set of shifts, and after a couple weeks, your schedule will change. you don't even need to talk to anyone or explain yourself.extremely easy to get time off (unpaid, of course). you don't need to call in or let anyone know if you can't work. you can literally walk out any time you want before the shift ends if you need to be somewhere. it just comes out of your unpaid time, which always seems to have way more hours than necessary for a normal human being (especially considering how easy it is to customize your shift choices). i mean seriously, if you're using all of your upt, then why do you even bother showing up at all?paid time off accumulates more slowly, but it's still there, and it's nice to have. -growth potential is incredible-fantastic ability to relocate just about anywhere-it's a company that is fun to work for since you know they want to win and do great things for their customers. it's fun to be a part of. learned a great deal in an incredibly short amount of time. was a good way to develop leadership skills and initiative quickly. co-workers, benefits, paid time off

call in if late or going to miss work 1.good work environment i like the open space2. you can work from home anytime3. tons of overtime meaning tons of workload amazon is pushing the envelope with new technology especially in the cloud computing and ebook space. amazon has many interesting projects to take advantage of all the interesting information it has on its user base. if you can get away from the legacy technology there's a lot of cool new stuff being worked on, and the people there are generally brilliant and passionate. it's a good place to learn a lot about technology and best practices. great compensation. extremely fast growing company. amazon shares with you how they manage one of the largest supply chains and how there are able to handle their operations to meet high demands. the only pro i can think of is that the hiring process was very very fast, maybe too fast for me to make an informed decission to work there. amazon can be a fun and interesting place to work. they do not care how you dress and they like cake. they also do some nice things like potluck meals and allow kids in for halloween. they do provide you with good computers and the comfort stuff you need to sit for hours. i've been here over 12 years and have had the opportunity to build all kinds of elaborate systems that changed the company. the early days were quite demanding, but the satisfaction was immense. i'm still challenged, but at a sustainable rate.the growth curve is like few other places. i interviewed an old mentor from hp 5 years after i'd left. i felt he'd atrophied, but the real deal is i'd grown tremendously.most jobs (i'm sure there are exceptions) use strong, current technologies. we clear the table and rub two sticks together to make a fire. as the smoke starts to generate, we may notice we've moved a pack of matches- but alas, we know this fire and where the hot spot is. keep rubbing the sticks together. this is also a competitive advantage, tight integration w/ every other piece of the system. the salary and signing bonus are pretty good.amazon might look good on your resume.you may gain a good reference or two. highly motivated environment and good culturevery technology driven and focussed. best innovation company of us - they are working on some of the most interesting products today based on my two years as a manager at the company:first, you get to work on problems that impact a huge number of customers, so scale and reliability are important things that are embedded in everything you do.second, you need to make sure the customers do not get impacted and retain their trust while trying to deliver faster with fewer resources.third, the customer goes first on top of everything else.four, i personally love how embedded leadership principles are in the culture of the company, they are used across to drive consensus that otherwise would require incurring in bunch of politics.five, things move surprisingly fast for such a big company.in summary you will have challenging work, very smart people to work with in the technical areas and you get to solve complex problems that can impact multiple customers

is good as well as the benefits. salary work team is good smart people make you better, challenging, fast-paced working for amazon is great for the cv and if you can manage to stick it out for a year you will feel that you have performed a miracle. most people don't last that long.amazon truly did have the smartest people i have ever worked with, sadly with very little 'social intelligence' or any life outside of work, no time to exercise, socialise, holiday... makes you wonder how smart they really are?amazon's long strategy to be the worlds most customer centric company is great, but only if you are a shareholder or customer. employees are chewed up, exhausted and spat out before being replaced with a fresh mba grad with fat loan repayments to keep up & no exposure to working for a decent company who think that the way people in this company behave is normal - it is not. good exposuregood balance between work and personal life great working environment. best benefits. innovation and hard work is recognized. amazon will promote quickly and compensate well. the pace is unbelievably quick and makes good or timely communication next to impossible. the lack of communication is one of the company's weak points. the atmosphere of the company is mostly positive and encouraging. personal and group recognition is common. -talented people. amazon has a lot of smart people.-new campus, so the buildings are clean and well-equipped.-great cafeteria. i had the best work lunches i've ever had at amazon. compensation, challenging, networking opportunities, three day weekends most of the year however you work 12-13 hr days it is a big company and therefore one might have very different kind of experiences depending on the group. the work environment is very aggressive. one thing it does is that it will help one get used to fast paced culture. it also could help one learn a lot depending on the area of work. however, it really depends on the role of an employee. take your dog to work. i joined amazon about 2 years ago and like most, i read the reviews on glassdoors and got so scared.amazon is a big company. everyone that has worked for large companies knows that there are always the pockets of bad teams or bad match between a hire and the company.now, it's also more common for people to write bad feedback than good feedback. as an example, it's rare to get out of a good experience on a restaurant and go write a good review on yelp. you will usually go and write a bad review when you didn't like something.back to topic! i'm having an amazing time at amazon. i manage 2 teams of developers, haven't had any attrition, the team is happy, and all of us work normal hours. we often have social events and there is very minimal top down guidance about how the team works and what we should focus on. we build our own roadmap and think long term. it really feels like working in a startup but much more stable.if you have the chance of working at amazon, ask lots of questions about the team you're going into, be passionate about the space you're working, and you will have a great time.oh, and if you by any chance join a bad team, after 1 year you can internally transfer without any problems. good benefits, decent hours, 3 days off every week. your health and welfare are a main priority at amazon. timely breaks . -good starting pay and benefits-there is a role for a tier 1 (sometimes a seasonal tier 3) that walks around and talks to associates about what their barriers are, both physical and internal, to accomplishing their jobs. this person then holds a daily meeting with all management to discuss how to improve the business for the associates. i have seen huge improvements to the business and moral directly related to this role.-room for advancement: if you show initiative and a willingness to learn and adapt there is always room to grow. we are opening many new facilities each year in many locations so higher tier employees will move up or out creating new opportunities. good benefits paid time off and restricted stock units that pay off if you do 2 years of service pay is competitive with the tech industry. great urban location. good pay, nice people. great place to work working for a well known company plenty of room for advancement i love my schedule because it works with my family life and commitments. coworkers are friendly and give you tips to improve performance. managers encourage employee feedback on how to improve working conditions. great benefits, friendly manager, and big warehouse pay is good and cost of living is lower than the bay area fast moving world but really dependent on teams. the company is big on data great company to work for it always be moving fast the first day you start working you receive benefits, good pay, fast-paced environment. honestly, the only pros were that i made some really good friends here. getting yelled at in front of several hundredpeople—checktreated as if you are in jail—checkbreaks federal and state laws—check there are many exciting opportunities at amazon, and it is possible to make a career at amazon through a combination of lateral and upward moves. i have been on 3 teams in under two years, and the flexibility to transfer has allowed me to get a good sense of the general challenges, expectations, and best practices for someone in my role in a way that i could not if i had spent the whole time with one team.amazon is truly customer obsessed, and for anyone who is interested in how the business runs and how amazon is able to maintain such high approval ratings from its customers, it is a fascinating place to work.amazon has a lot of data, and learning how a company of this size stores, retrieves, analyzes, and safeguards its data is a great preparation for wherever else you might work as a business intelligence professional / data scientist. you have the opportunity to get a lot of analysis experience here.you will get the opportunity to work with aws. a lot. it's so inspiring to work with so many intelligent, hard working people who are truly invested in making great products and services for people around the globe. best company to work for, excellent team and great new technology intense, passionate co-workers who will push you to deliver your very best each day on behalf of our customers. the opportunity to pioneer and build something that didn't exist before; a rare opportunity at this scale in any industry. work backwards from the customer's needs/challenges to solve their problems without constraining yourself and unleashing your ability to think big get to learn a lot, good tools easily accessible, and like i said other teams are good. the manager decided how bad or good your work life will be - opportunity to run a large multi-million dollar business at a generally relatively young age- leadership will work with you to gear side projects towards your long-term career interests- incredible learning opportunity- wfh is possible occasionally- you can bring your dog to work- everyone is incredibly smart and it is nice to constantly work around intelligent individuals helpful, friendly coworkersvery good benefits mandatoey overtime which is good for those that want to work themselves to death. decent benefits. great way for introduction to leadership. very basic principles. good benefits, for

plenty of great opportunities and challenges, if you have management that will resource you properly. some teams (orgs) appear to be properly resourced, while other teams and orgs are drastically under resourced (strategically lean they like to call it). + you have the opportunity to learn a lot of different departments and train on a lot of different equipment throughout the warehouse.+ pay is better than a lot of warehouse positions+ benefits are pretty decent, as far as premiums and deductibles go learn a lot with limited tools; helps motivated people learn more and do more. the city is good, close to water and the offices are in downtown. small team feel in a giant company. flexible work schedule. large influence on product design and decisions. freedom to invent and think big. opportunities to work on just about anything imaginable. flexible shifts. good working environment good work life balance and growth in career. great people and good learning. i have thoroughly

facility and office space. well organised work culture and methods this is a mnc which works like a startup.lots of learning opportunitiesit doesn't matter what time you come in as long as you are doing your work. i've been at amazon for a little over 2 months as a recruiter within the university talent acquisition and development program (tadp). so far i am really enjoying starting my career at amazon. my manger is a great person to work with who is very intersted in the career development of his direct reports and truly wants to help everyone be their best. while i can't speak for all recruiting teams at amazon, my team has a great work life balance and i have found that my co-workers are very open to answer my questions as a new recruiter. there are many perks that come with working for a massive corporate company like amazon and they include, but are not limited too, solid pay/benefits, great speakers/presentations around campus, nice work areas and a beautiful campus that has a lot of activities and food options within walking distance. the company culture is not for everyone, it's really focused on improvement and working for our customers not ourselves, so i encourage everyone to read the leadership principals before they apply to make sure the culture resonates with them. innovative, fun, challenging, rewarding. i am proud to work here. i work at aws, and love the pace of growth and innovation, and the amazing aws cloud services, as well as the transformational impact we bring into our customers' lives around the world. it's great to be a part of such awesome global force.i'm surrounded with highly competent, driven, yet super friendly professionals, who actually want to work all day, every day, to achieve results (yep, i find it rare and highly beneficial).i love the challenges we get to solve on daily basis - never get bored.management sets vision and direction, and trusts that you'll take the initiative to implement it to your best judgement and ability (no micro-management). they ask what they can do to help every day.arguably led by the best ceo on the planet, great leadership team, flat management structure.great work/life balance - very reasonable performance expectations, giving you a chance to over-achieve them. i choose to work extra hours because i want to achieve more each week, like most around me - but it's not mandatory.great compensation package. i work in the aws division as a cloud support engineer and i have never seen a smarter group of engineers. a huge amount of employees here have masters or higher level education, so even the people in lower level positions are experts in something you probably arent. this provides an amazing learning environment and i feel like my career has progressed more quickly by being able to learn from the best.there has been significant room for promotion from within based on merit, and the requirements for such are clearly defined. i have not felt like politics played a part in the decisions which is always refreshing. i have been able to prove my value through visible milestones and have been recognized accordingly. it has also been possible to choose the direction and teams i wished to move forward with. a high emphasis is placed on skill development and cross team training which helps with lateral and upward mobility as well.finally, i feel like what i do has a real and global impact. i work with some of the largest companies in the world as well as amazon retail, and ill occasionally hear about things i was a part of in the news. i would not have had these kinds of opportunities at a smaller company. groudbreaking projects used by around the world. it feels like we are writing operating system for the next 100 years :-)one can achieve anything here as long as they have energy and interest.in my team work/life balance is very good. i don't feel pressure from management to do overtime, we did put more hours in order to release my current project on time. work culture, work on new technologies, location.. seattle is a decent city to live except the rent prices going up every year :) +things move quickly, but you achieve and learn at a really satisfying rate+work with really bright people - if you're tired of being in the big fish in the small pond, you'll love amazon because you'll be surrounded by big fish+invent and simplify -

development is taken seriously. there's no reason to stagnate.+emphasis on delivering results. i love that everything i do has an end result, i'm not just spinning my wheels and waiting for some

decent starting paypretty flexible hoursable to make a lot of overtime i've been with amazon for over 8 years, working as an sr. software development engineer currently on-track to a likely principal engineer promotion within a few years.if you find the right team, both in terms of one which fits your strengths and which has good management, amazon can be an amazing place to work: the challenges are substantial, the problems interesting, and you can make changes which really make it to the bottom line, not to mention public recognition. i have actually had the experience of a friend saying, \"you know, i just discovered something on amazon,\" to which i could reply, \"yes, i was one of the key engineers on that project.\"movement within the company is highly encouraged. if i start to feel like i'm \"burning out\" on a team, there is easy ability to move to a different one. a few loopholes which made it possible for a manager to \"hold onto\" an employee they didn't want to move were recently closed in a policy update.i actually find the work-life balance very good; i work roughly 45 hour weeks most of the time, though in the summer probably fall back to 40 (or less) due to outdoor activities (unrelated to work) i participate in. there will usually be a few weeks of the year where i end up working long hours to meet some deadline or deal with an operational issue, but \"long hours\" are usually in the 55 to 60 hour range. i know there are teams out there which have problems with work-life balance, but honestly, within the company, they are well-known. as such, people with experience within the company avoid those teams like the plague. (hint: if the team has a name which seems related to the burning of materials, there's a good chance it's one to avoid.)the longer an organization has existed within the company, the likely better it is to work for. retail is (more or less) a pretty good place to work, aws used to be harsh but is getting better, but as you get into the newest big projects, the work can be more suspect. that being said, both retail and aws have some fascinating projects.if you know how to negotiate, you can get a very good salary out of amazon as an experienced hire; i don't know that college hires have it as easy. amazing people and environment depending on what group you work in a lot of growth potentialdecent pay good pay, good coworkers, will pay for school, stock options, ability to move up in company 1. now is a good time to work at aws as the cloud computing domain is evolving2. will gain extensive knowledge on distributed systems there are lot of opportunities in amazon. if you don't like your role you can always apply for other roles(you get it if you're lucky). pays quite well for a very simple stress free role. if you have a good manager you can grow well here. i would say its a very good place for freshers to start their career before moving to other companies. one of the best work environments i've ever seen. transparency is followed well, a good place to start off with friendly broad minded team members nice environment, you will be surrounded by smart people from all over the world good working environment and working ethics very fast paced activities, lots of work to do, good pay, good vacation, pays very well. very passionate the logistics of the process of fba(fulfillment by amazon) is exceptional. the amount of knowledge i garnered during my years in amazon helped me achieve better opportunities. it is an amazing organisation with regard to the salary or the benefits provided to an employee. positive company culture, work-life balance. fun place to work, no dress code and a pretty chilled out work culture. good company, reasonable salary, good environment. there is a lot to learn : amazon uses a lot of new technologies in its code base. you will get to

apparently easy to explore other teams after clocking in an year with a team. good working environment. each friday is fun friday in 1.5 years at amazon, i've learned more about scaling the build and operations of software services any i could have imagined. competitive pay with bonus. good starting job. amazing offices. too good a professional ethic.absolutely love the work environment this job

good work culture n facilities excellent work environment.sports facilities and transport are additional perks. good experience and improve self leadership big companies like amazon spend a lot of money and efforts to create the best work environment. the overtime pay is okay pay is ok, great pay if you work nights.that's about it really, my opinion is completely based on my experience as a christmas temp picker so i can't say much about any schemes or pensions they do (if they have any). fun place to work. fantastic support from management. lots of growth opportunities. good relationship, kind people. but localization is a problem. it's a good company but not good stratgy might be. good company to start over your carreer. it was a great experienece. meet a lot of different and new people. the environment is always changing, super fast paced and is innovative. surrounded by smart people, and some have the opportunity to grow into leadership roles fairly quickly. at amazon you're surrounded by the best and the brightest. the interview loop is famously difficult, but very effective at ensuring that the company maintains extremely high standards. there is no driftwood - everyone contributes (and is expected to). although there is some office politics, there is far less than i've seen at other companies. the leadership principles (study them if you're interviewing) aren't just window dressing - they're adhered to and used as a yardstick for everything from new product initiatives to your annual review. you'll learn more and become better at your job at amazon, because you have to. and once you've put in a tour of duty at amazon, everything else will seem easy. many projects you could choose to work on amazon's moniker to work hard and play hard is no joke, they will work your butt off the moment you walk through the doors. with that said though, they are very flexible in anything that is going on in life to help you. technologies, peers, culture, location, team sometimes work can be fun and entertaining. small work shifts. theme days, music. great work environmenteasily accessible to transportation they will hire anyone. as long as you've got half a brain, you're more than capable of doing the job. it's not as hard as people say. 4 day work week is nice very smart people;very little office politics: people generally try to do the right thing for the customer/companydecent work/life balance, at least where i've been few teams really have good work , talented people to work with nice working environment; great internship program leading the way in operations - this is a great place to be as amazon is at the forefront of innovation in operations. signing bonus for the first 2 years ($30,000 each year)bonus is a growing vestment of stock over 4 years of $110k total. year one=5%, year 2=15%, 20% every 6 months from years 3 to 4. there is a good scope of learning. contrary to popular belief, one can exercise a good work/life balance. but as always it is very subjective.it is my strong belief that working for one year at amazon is equivalent to what you learn at microsoft in two-three years. this is mainly due to very diversified array of tools and products you need to work on. if not master of one, amazon will certainly force you to be jack of many. coworkers were great. many days went by fast. pay was good. people always have helpful advice for you. you will really learn a lot there. outstanding benefits unlimited opportunities for advancement fun atmosphere lots of contests and raffles as their subtitle says work hard have fun make history if you work hard then you can party harder in amazon*work culture is awesome*great freedom there is great appreciation,encouragement and

in this even though it is non technical you can switch your department parallely great growth potential and variety of areas you can be running a team within 3 years as the training is available to you, fantastic meaning to working at amazon and having the opportunity after only 8 months of promotion was a great plus. a good place to workindividual freedom is providedno restrictionsfree to work

interesting to work on it. all the leadership principles are part of the job. without which you cannot get into amazon or cannot perform in amazon. exposure with the best minds of the field. the benefits at amazon are fabulous: great health insurance almost completely paid for by the company, stock, 401k, monthly bonuses based on building success. amazon is never boring for those in a role above that of warehouse associate or in a support role. things are always changing to meet the needs of the customer and it is always challenging. amazing culture, fantastic leadership and opportunities. excellent career growth options and paths, due to easy internal transfer. great brand name that is recognised globally, it's likely you'll work with some of the most driven and smart people you're likely to encounter. this in turn can rub off on you and enable you to raise your game, at a cost. friendly, active, good, developing, helping the biggest pro will be that you will not be working at an outsourced company. it would be directly for the company. so growth in to other areas of amazon is a possibility. but it depends on performance. ownership, responsibilities, leadership qualities, quality of work, flexible office hours good pay, talented & fun coworkers, flexible hours, work from home, wide selection of food trucks at lunch time multi-billion dollar company that is relatively new. plenty of room to climb the corporate ladder. they count two years of amazon experience as a bachelors degree. -competitive salaries with rsus-entrepreneurial spirit

perform. this may be important to some, but background checks are irrelevant there. amazon is a very healthy, growing company and if one wants to work in the amazon web services division it is growing very rapidly and is a good resume experience-builder for younger developers.overall, i have had excellent cooperation from management in having a flexible schedule and support in managing difficult family matters;while not as cutting-edge as google in many respects, amazon does tend to make use of recent technologies and moves along technically at a fair clip in most areas. strong innovator with lots of opportunity if you get connected with the right team. lots of opportunities, global openings, great customer focus looks great on paper, good potential for growth if you are willing to work weekdays, weeknights and while you sleep. good opportunity to learn and develop cool environment, enough growth opportunities great salary they offer; highest as per company standard iam happy to work here because of their sincerity and timely payment,not only that they are well developed and and were honest and shows their happy gratitude with others it gives a lot to us all are pros there apart from the inside politics which is everywhere always something to learncompetitive wage in munich cool workplace to work with all good very understanding company i joined amazon as a sr product manager. so far i really enjoyed working here for several reasons:1. culturei like amazon's 14 leadership principles (lp) and the company's culture formed based on lps. many companies have culture out there but not every company and employee can truly internalize it. at amazon, i met many good performers who truly internalized the lps and apply them in their daily work. for example, teams are often \"customers\" to each other internally, and you can see that lps such as customer obsession, think big etc. are impacting every decision making. such practices not only benefit one's customers but benefit their own work as well.2. data & logic-driven decision making + clear/concise/direct communicationmany people have heard about the \"6-pager\" white paper practice. often i need to write one-pager (high level of a program/project), two-pagers or six-pagers (the \"white paper\"), prfaqs etc. they are very helpful for me to organize my thoughts and push me to develop thorough thinking, and to use data, voice of customers etc. to build a strong case. this is a very good practice to improve my personal capability, not just \"something i have to do for my job\". clear/concise/direct communication also works effective and widely acceptable here so that we can all be effective and focus.3. many internal opportunities across organizations/teams/locations if you are a performer.4. many learning opportunities as long as you have passion to learn and don't mind working hard/going extra miles :-) worked with some of the smartest and determined peers who work very hard to get where they want to be. my peers were the best part of the job and the unity of the area managers is unmatched. you will learn a lot and learn it very fast. this job is a crash course in every difficult situation you can go through as a manager. this job definitely made me a stronger manager. you will push yourself for this job mentally and physically, but the positive is you learn what you want in your career. super flexible. constant learning and improvement. the bar is set pretty high which i really like. you are encouraged to make noise on behalf of your customers. great daily pay rate, friendly atmosphere good work culture, you keep learning throughout your work. very exciting! great culture- have fun. work hard. make history.never gets boring. always new changes at a fast pace.customer obsessed- you feel like you are making a real meaningful impact. amazon is a very dynamic company. though its turnover rate is high, it offers opportunity for people who are new and willing to work hard. and there is fewer politics problem compared with other companies, like microsoft or google that i have worked for before i can't say anything bad. pros and cons may vary from team to team.great work environmentflexible schedulemany opportunities to learngreat team culture great company, very fast, pay well, many help from other people,big profesionality inside this comapy very strong company culture - 14 leadership principles sodexos, night home drops, 2 team outings a year flexibility of schedulesgood work-life balance friendly behaviour by everyone especially managers, whole lot of fun stuff goes on in peak time form nov to jan. no work pressure for 6 months amazon deals with large scale problems, so you get to see those first hand. pay can increase fairly quickly for top candidates with strong education and experience.health insurance, retirement and vacation, are extremely competitive with, if not superior to, other sectors.ownership - amazon treats you like an owner - a grown up. you have a job to do and you are empowered to do it. amazon got very friendly and loving environment to work with. managers, leads , colleagues always there to help you out with your problem. excellent fast learning job with a couple of smart colleagues. the customer is always at the first place and all the activities done are focused on the customers' requests.

best i've come across in my work experience. 4 day work week and great work atmosphere i have been a software developer at a subsidiary of amazon for over 4 years. in that time i have done some very, very interesting things which have become successful products and services. i have also learned a lot about the right way to do things. employees tend to be high quality, but not as high as they think they are. it seemed easy to get the job. the work, while physically demanding, wasn't difficult once i got in shape. innovative and collaborative...great workplace. always cutting edge work and forward thinkers. ownership, pace of learning, supportive yet tough environment. long term career opportunities and movement within the company--once you've put your time in. good pay, lots of overtime if you need it. amazon's customer focus is the most genuine i've worked with to date, not like other companies who put some fancy words on the wall then do everything they can to ignore them.compensation is decent, especially singing bonuses which are huge. relocation expenses are generous especially for expat hires. share plan is pretty decent, if weighted toward later years.teams are very small - usually around 10-20 people - so relatively agile groups working on thousands of different things all at the same time so there's always something new and exciting being announced. coordination between teams is mostly achieved though management which leaves the engineers on the ground free to execute.amazon is really ideal for interns, junior and mid-level developers - it's a great place to cut your teeth on big problems, get a lot of responsibility very quickly and rack up those crucial years of experience for your cv with a company that looks greatamazon itself is clearly still on the way up. for a company that makes no money, it's growing super fast, doubling it's full time staff every couple of years, taking on more and more projects, breaking into new markets and technologies. if there's a peak amazon is still a way from reaching it and the stock price reflects thisthe head office is dog friendly - you can take your dog to work with you which is pretty cool good pay, great learning experience everyone is inventing all the time so there isn't a chance for the job to get dull or mundane.i work with amazingly bright and supportive people so there is always someone around to teach me what i don't know. aws fosters innovation. engineers from many teams collaborate to get things done and iterate on improving the ecosystem as a whole. it's truly an amazing process to behold.- always innovating.- some of the best engineers in the world at your fingertips.- learning never stops.- diving deeper as time goes on.- flexible with working from home (team dependent).- fun environment. great company good benefits. stock options. money and stocks and vto none that i can think off. good pay and freedom with your own time interesting problems to work on, particularly in a largely expanding company it's always an active day in the warehouse, and it'll keep you in shape. the work in the warehouse is very easy. you're mostly in control of your own success. great benefits for a job that's easy to get. stock benefits are nice. learning and growth opportunities, competitive pay always had a paycheck when ubqorkes no issues that time had paid time of personal time and hours accumulated that by could use with outg being held again you the role, technology, and the peers are beyond awesome. in every event, i work directly with customers and partners that are as excited about amazon technology as we are and my peers are the professionals i most admire. great culture, fast paced environment, no bureaucracy, great future and business plans the pay is good great enterprenuerial environment where one can really make an impact on the business. great co-workers who work hard at what they do. input was actively solicited by senior management and i felt that my opinion was valued and listened to. amazon has a great future and it is exciting to be a part of that. the best reason to work at amazon is that it gives you the ability to control your own destiny. if you are assertive and hard working then you will go places, just keep up the hard work and people will notice. you will get the opportunity to work with lots of other bright people on massive scaling problems. amazon is an excellent place to work right out of college. your mileage will vary depending on the particular group you work in but there are lots of opportunities to move between teams once on board. i have been able to secure interviews with ease since leaving amazon and managed to sharpen my c++ and sql skills pretty dramatically while at the company. i was given a raise every review cycle during my stay at amazon and was happy with the salary and benefits i received. to get paid a decent wage good opportunity to learn about ebusiness at a large scale.innovation does happen at amazon.one can move around within the company and gain exposure to various aspects of the business.compensation is pretty good but not if you consider the benefits and time demands. i highly recommend amazon. as an engineer, you have a vast amount of resources and tools to get the job done and the infrastructure is such that you don't have to bug it to install this and that on your servers (unlike other companies). your team takes ownership of almost every aspect of your product, so there is a lot of opportunity to improve how it runs with limited red tape. there is a huge emphasis on working on large-scale systems which is both fun and an educational experience. compensation. they pay well and its looks great on your resume. but they dont pay overtime and every person works 55-60 hour weeks at amazon. they get their money's worth. there is little bureaucracy and a relatively flat hierarchy. many members of senior management have a technical background and are very intelligent. they are also open to ideas and respectful of other employees. one of amazon's corporate values is frugality which usually leads the company to avoid and cut unnecessary spending such as fancy furniture for senior management, or expensive benefits packages for niche groups. amazon is a relatively efficient, fun, profitable company to work for. good company, great products, forward looking and innovative solid benefits, 4 day work weeks quick growth opportunities. hardworking teammates entry level grows faster by hard pushing and with more than expected responsibilities.easy to have large impact you are a hard-worker or mail generator or nonsense speaker. co-workers and benefits paid time off great experience in terms of learning new

and never dull. advancement is there for those who want it. you can relocate anywhere you want, amazon is everywhere. open work environment, challenging tasks, never boring, interesting projects pretty relaxing environment. it's still solid hard work, though. they offer cool perks here and there, especially during the holiday season. seems like there are potential opportunities for growth also. great daily pay rate, friendly atmosphere extremely high ownership very quickly in your careerability to move and learn new functions across the firm (although that's changed with the recent hiring freeze in the retail divisions)innovation + automation great benefits, many different teams to cater to everyone's interests great pay, fun atmosphere, get to customers every day lives. the leadership principles are no bs and guide pretty much every decision. get hardcore and authentic product management experience here. i love that the company has a set of principles that really drive how they think and operate. they're part of everything that we do. if you read them (published as amazon.com's leadership principles) and aren't inspired, this may not be the best place for you. flexible work schedule. decent hourly pay. great benefits for a part time job. great place to be in if you like your work to be kind of a roller coaster ride, with lot of twists and turns and

on the customer and we bet big. truly refreshing and motivating. i am challenged as a leader in a way that i have never been in past roles and as a result i am growing every day. -flexible hours, you choose all your shifts after working for a few months.-great as a side job, only requirement is working 10 hours a month, so if you're in school or working another more demanding job prime now can be a nice side thing for extra money-fairly easy work most of the days i spent working at the fulfillment center were either very fun or felt very rewarding at the end of the night. it was usually pretty motivating and management did make a consistent effort to make the environment fun(ny) and exciting. in a way, it was like getting paid to have a gym membership. also, the physical conditions are excellent compared to other warehouses--very comfortable even though hot at times unless you stay hydrated. my location was very willing to train employees on other areas and most of the time i wasn't doing the same thing each week. i enjoyed coming into work most of the time. trainers/feedback is meant to help you and isn't accusatory, there were also coaches in your similar position (stower/packer/counter/...) that would help you along the way. at the stand-up meetings, most of the time you were aware of how you were functioning as an individual and as part of your team, always fun competitions for gift cards and so on based on productivity. career advancement / tuition reimbursement is possible even if not directly related to amazon (for healthcare such as phlebotomy and others), this is excellent for college students paying bills along the way to further themselves through amazon or elsewhere. i made a couple new friends. there are not any at all after 10+ years there is still a lot to learn and discover, and ways to have big impact for both customers and employees. i have fortunate to have been on 4 great teams. i have been given many opportunities to do new things, travel, take on global responsibility and pushback. through org changes, maternity leave, and personal highs and lows, i have always felt supported and valued. if your able to get in throu amazon the pay is coo but most likely smx will be the one to hire you nice starting wage and training 1.project ownership2. learn a lot within a short period of time best place for learning, strongly recommend to the people who wanted to learn design and implementation of system. to some it may sound good. until you hear the \"they are just the walmart for online shopping.\" there's little to hang your hat on. the initiatives get watered down, but at least there are initiatives. publicly traded corporation. billions in assets. okay, in other words it's a stable company, you can say you have a secure job. easy to get into. i recommend waiting when they have a direct hire event to get in direct with amazon and not thru an agency. you get all the good benefits, health, dental, vision, life, 401k, restricted stock units, pto, vacation, unpaid, discounts etc. all on the first day of employment when direct hire. the fulfillment center is high tech, well ventilated and water stations are plenty to keep hydrated during job. not much micro managing. hr is easily accessible as they are on the floor. nice cafeteria style lunch rooms with variable lunch options if you want to buy. scattered bathrooms thought center as well. what else.. oh and plenty of free parking. i liked working nights and enjoyed my time there as short as it was. july 2014 until november 2014. - lots of learning opportunities with wide range of technologies being used- good pay and benefits- management cares for personal growth and career development love it good company great pay company values,

to hone ones skills. -salary-stock options-high standards to support customer experiencei managed a great team of both new managers and experienced managers. people really have a desire to do well and learn and improve. if you want to work on a huge distributed system with a lot of independence amazon is a great place. every team acts like a small start-up and has a lot of freedom. you will learn very quickly and get a lot of responsibility. there is no bureaucracy or processes which get in your way, so you will be able to decide on your own (with peer guidance) and build quickly. i was amazed every day how complex and challenging things i can do and how much i learned.if you want to have an interesting job where you can grow and do not mind to work hard you may be willing to accept that amazon is not perfect. yes, there are few companies which are equally interesting and have a better culture and perks, but it's much easier to fail interviews there - you know, the prettiest girl in town may be fussy like hell. not that it's trivial to get to amazon, but it's for sure easier.the unique knowledge and experience that you will get in amazon is priceless and worth all the disadvantages described below. you will not learn distributed systems just from books and amazon is a perfect place to do it. and there is a chance that you will fall in love with the company and stay there for long. if not, what you learn will significantly increase your chances to get a much better job. plenty of overtime if you are a workaholic - if you have a pulse you can get a job here. easy to get hired whether it's direct or through integrity staffing. needed employment to support myself casual environment, no dress code, good pay, some opportunity to work from home (depending on manager) lots of things to improvegreat people to work with and learn frompushes you to think simple and innovate sign on bonus and relocation package are nice. great experience in managing tough associates. despite my low star-rating there were a few perks available when working for the fulfillment center. there is a machine that dispenses terrible but free coffee in some of the break rooms. there is a half-hearted attempt to provide some climate control in the heat of the summer months. the price of health benefits are somewhat reasonable for a single person such as myself. quite a few vacation days are offered which is wonderful because you'll need every one of them! upper management such as hr are very attentive, and always available. great hours to choose from all the time. i love that it is fast paced. -pays pretty decently because of all the overtime and whatnot-it's a new warehouse and its pretty nice inside, everything is easily reachable during break etc.-mostly everyone is pretty nice good physical activity and flexible hours benefits get full time hours - a job.- met some nice people enduring the same experience as me. perhaps the difference is that i'm approaching this from late in life. i was thrilled to be hired at 62 and am by far not the oldest. it's hard work and it beats me up almost every night but i feel accomplished. also, i chose to work and do not have to worry about making rent. the pay is way above minimum and management is firm, but fair. every workplace has drama, but on night sort we all do all of the jobs and are on more/less equal footing. it surprises me that i like it. after a lifetime of job stress in the \"cube farm\" it's a pleasure to show up, put in the effort, clock out and go home without taking it with me. there are small perks they don't have to do: pizza, candy, swagbucks, time off at will, t-shirts, gift cards. and you will get in shape. rsu compensation has been great for long term employees. company is truly customer obsessed and very dynamic environment to work within 1. you meet a lot of super smart and hard-working people here. you'll become a competent coder, designer, and architect in no time. engineers are usually nice and willing to help.2. the pay is great especially if it is your first full-time job.3. you can work from home if you do not have any meetings scheduled.4. because the work

traveling 80%, (saving money expensing food, transportation while traveling)* fast-growing team, many career opportunities collaborative, fast-paced, cutting edge technology/products, great benefits (particularly for mothers), plenty of opportunity to set your scope and thrive so far so good, i’m still in training, but maybe that will interest some. i am on my 4th day at amazon, & will work in their customer service dept. for a guaranteed 3 months & possibly 3 more depending on how busy they are & whatnot. they talk a lot about doing a great job by not missing work, empathizing with & develop a great repore with the customer by being “customer obsessed” i am in a class of 25 & we have 2 trainers. i think they are both fabulous! they are always available, they don’t rush through everything, check with all 25 of us individually on about a daily basis, they answer most questions via a chat room & if they know the answer they offer a quick response, even when you pm them, it’s still super quick, i believe they both want the best for all of us, and they will do whatever it takes to help us all do well enough to become full time employees if we want it bad enough, i believe it will be possible.also!! starting this month all wah customer service employees are provided with a hp chromebook laptop, & a headset. basically, all i needed was a home office w/no distractions, an ethernet cord and a decently fast wired internet connection. i also highly recommend though they are not required, the following: keyboard, mouse, usb hub (doesn’t have to be expensive), at least 1 extra computer monitor (i got mine at goodwill for $10 & it came with the cord too & it is the smartest thing i bought!). everything i just said must be wired, amazon requires it, no wifi & no bluetooth. the laptop they provide is very small & it will be extremely difficult to see the writing on the monitor & toggle between several websites. right now i am using my goodwill monitor as my primary and my laptop’s monitor as my 2nd & it works well for me. however, because it’s so cheap, i’m going to buy a 2nd larger monitor & put my little laptop under a monitor stand & that will open up a lot of desk space.i got to pick my schedule, i was able to pick between 4-10 hr or 5-8 hr shifts. there were a plethora of choices & i believe they will work for pretty mostly any schedule. great growth as a new grad. dynamic work environment, ability to deal with numerous different projects, job rewards creativity, high levels of autonomy, overall excellent job benefits. they will literally hire anyone that can pass a background check and drug test.no interview, often immediate hire.good paygood benefitsflexible work schedulemostly nice managers3 days off a week unless peak seasonlimited time off whenever you wanttwo 15min breaks, one clock out 30 min lunch break. short hours but good pay great support system. everyone helps you, and takes care of your questions. easier than other

an upper level four day work week 10 hour days good work, nice peoples, ok management benefits are crazy good best health i've ever had plenty of opportunity. plenty of work. great benefits. lots of friendly competitions. great chances of winning great prizes. caring staff members. great benefits and diverse workforce a good place to learn a lot of stuff. awesome culture with people that continue to push the envelope. none was very good and i liked it alot great benefit for student who are looking for tuition guidanceflexible schedules for full-time students + i feel free at aws. it's 100% true that if you write a good pr-faq and 6-pager, you can get your ideas turned into the next service.+ we do crazy things to keep our team culture alive, and that's always cool provided you deliver results.+ if you do a good job and have the right metrics in place to measure the impact of your work, you are rewarded. i have found the system transparent and fair, and have been promoted twice.+ at aws anyway, the startup culture is definitely alive and well.. but you get the benefits of a large enterprise. don't like your job? there are thousands of openings. a good percentage of my team came through inbound transfers. work and life balance, tech update fast. co-workers are willing to help you in the work. and the work environment is so nice. smart people everywhere who care about the customer, the company, and you. flexible work life balance. good resources to get the job done. i love this place. i have no plans of going anywhere. no one here holds your hand. you're expected to come knowing how to do what you do, and if you don't, you go figure it out. no one will tell you \"this is how we do it here\" (except maybe legal). if you don't like where you are, you can absolutely change it--and that is great. great software platform/tools to develop!

personal computers and consumer electronics as such is a tough category where products come in and phase out in very short cycles and are often unprofitable. so you will experience high pressure given that this category has a high topline impact and often adverse bottomline impact. so you can get several years of experience in a few years.

environment launch fast, smart people, great salary. amazon is a resume-maker, make no doubt about it. within months of having updated my linkedin profile, i had recruiters from google, microsoft, apple, and others reaching out (i ended up interviewing at several and jumping ship to microsoft). i'm sure this is partly due to fact of amazon's reputation as being not the most pleasant place to work (so its employees are receptive to an 'out' more than some others) and because they are known to have a high bar for hiring..it's also full of very smart people (though many of them are not nearly as smart as they *think* they are) and you get to work on big, challenging problems.lastly, their publicly professed focus on the customer is absolutely legitimate. it was great to see how they approached this from the inside as it's something i think amazon gets uniquely right in the tech industry. lots of growth and opportunities understanding of how the company works and why it has been so successful. the processes and structure of the organization are outstanding and everything really does operate around delivering the customer. ok if you come out of varsity or college to set you up for your next career step; nothing more than a stepping stone. easy job, friendly environment and people they really do care about the buyers and they will ensure that customer issues are addressed.they have improved in recruiting more women, yet fewer women in higher positions. amazon is the largest organization around the world we have the future for growth nice benefitsok paynice

in everything, so amazon is certainly doing something right.- you really make history and get to have lot of fun....don't take the negatives below to discourage yourself. company is growing faster than it's able to evolve itself from attending to the needs of their employee \"customers\" and many things put into the system to make it work fairly don't seem to work all the time. pay, health care, paid time off. am truly want their employee to move in the company very flexible shifts (day, evening, or night) which helps with school. the pay is fair and it increases every other year. great job flexibility. great location. excellent place to work; good environment money is good, there are mentors available for sde1s and managers have incentive to get you promoted. there are also tech talks every week and a strong engineering culture. if you want to learn, you have infinite opportunities to do so. i work at a specialty site which prints and ships books on demand. the process is easy and simple. associates who work here care about quality and work extremely hard. like marmite, you love it or you hate it.there are some very well run teams, and others not so much. i have experienced both. badly run teams, as in any other company, will be very unproductive and extremely frustrating.that said, in general:(+) dynamic, lots of things happening around you, and some very cool stuff being tested/launched.(+) many opportunities to change roles within the company and take on new challenges. internal transfers are encouraged.(+) good team spirit, people are willing to help each other and collaborate.(+) lots of autonomy in making decisions, everybody can be an \"owner\".(+) you are always very busy, and there is no room for slackers. hiring process is very quick, due to the desperation to hire , cause they can't keep anyone. they share their \"peculiar ways\" up front, and they follow them.it truly is a meritocracy for the most part.it was great working with so many extremely talented people. working at amazon, for the first time in nearly three years, i actually felt like a human being. they care about their employees as more than just a number, as more than just a body in a chair, and that is an amazing feeling. they treat their employees well, spoil them more than a little, and generally just try and make sure they are happy employees. flexibility and networking with other departments. the hours were very flexible as long as i hit my numbers. bleeding edge technology and projectsswitching teams is encouragedhard problems to solve very innovative, lots of opportunity to learn fairly good benefits if you can stick to it its a great company to work for. it will make you work harder unleasing your true potential and also recognises for the same. all facilities are der easily ease at work.no pressure.rotational shifts that change 3-4 times a year. gud salary has a better work culture than any other companies which boast about themselves. no dress code fast paced, start up feel, loads of work to dovery hands on evironmentcloud is the next big thing to be in! for an engineer, not excited about the roller-coaster ride in a start-up, it cannot get any better than amazon. you will get to work of technologies that need to scale to cater million if customer, and hundreds of million requests made by these customers. with aws as backbone, and working with tons of in-house and open source technologies, you will gain invaluable experience, which ensure both technical and financial growth. the companies motto of being frugal and passing the saving to the customer will ensure you always come up with the right engineering solution to problem. lot of things to learn for a fresher, no micro management, good facilities,flexible timings. experience, smart people, guinness in royal oak package with caveats: the stock is pretty decent for the first couple of years, then it overperforms and you're like totally screwed (\"it's not our fault we did so well\" cry the fat cats)some people are really decent and they try super hard. good culture was tranperent and people were humble and seen mentors encouraging their peers to grow along with them money is pretty good for an unskilled job that hires about anybody. benefits (insurance and discounts) are immediately available after orientation. fun company to work for you know what you'll be doing everyday. the insurance is great. my coworkers are like family, decent pay and hours, though permanent employees earned more. great pay, hard to generalize experience as it really depends what team you get put on. decent intern events and networking opportunities, open events at amazon to allow interns to learn and take as much as they want. return offer is possible as well based on performance. decent working conditions. good pay and benefits. pays more than big lots. but other than that everything about this company is all about the bottom line no matter who they hurt. interesting problems. good coworkers. most people keep reasonable hours. good people and fast days 12.50 an hour 20 hrs week. compensation - competitive salary + signing bonus + rsu’sfast-paced environment - always on the go4-day work weeks (outside of peak/prime day week/ot weeks)good hiring decisions - most managers are smart, driven, fun people.tons of promotional opportunities due to network expansion.constantly changing/improving (can be seen as a con to those who don’t adapt well to change) amazon offers competitive compensation, especially as the stock price is going up.they're always exploring new areas to grow in and show little to no fear in trying out new business directions.the seattle area is growing more lively with all the development that is happening from amazon expanding. (however it is also raising housing prices, which is only good if you bought property years ago.)because product and engineering have a long history at amazon, working in those disciplines have their own unique amazon cultural quirks that have succeeded in driving the company to where it is now. absolutely no existing pro what so ever if you're a hard worker and have a positive attitude, there are tons of opportunities to learn new processes. i love working at amazon. the high volume atmosphere and the constant rush creates an extremely competitive environment but in a fun way! one team, one dream. i love being able to work together as a group and being able to challenge each other while having a good time. work hard, have fun, make history! innovation, cares about the community $2,000 in amazon visa gift cards in your account every day wonderful employee interaction. excellent opportunities to advance. the projects and scope of work are unlike anywhere else in the world. i love that i can easily switch teams and try a variety of products that use different technology and target different customers. there are also many very smart, driven, and creative people that make this a workplace where you will learn a ton, no matter what your background. the pay is also very competitive, thanks to the growing stock price. good pay , easy innovative companyas an employee you are exposed to a complete echo system the ambience and the work culture in amazon, you are given full guidance with adequate time to understand the processes. then you are empowered to think, to decide, to act as a business owner and to impact the business. in other organizations, often this approach isn't practiced. what i love about working at amazon is that you get to be surrounded by brilliant, hard working and kindly people. it's extremely rare to find a company where one's opinion and ideas (always based on data) are listened to and even valued. nowhere else have i felt i could have such an impact on my company and customers (internal and external). it's a thrilling and exciting company to work for. lots of innovation, great minds around good work environment, friendly people, learn

up -very high pay-huge opportunities for career growth-stock bonuses after 2 years consistent exponential growth that foster opportunities to delvelop and be challenged easy job to get if 18 years old. pay and benefits are great. many locations to choose from. because amazon is not focused on previous experience, it is easy to get hired right out of college. amazon is an environment where you can easily grow and learn a lot. great learning experience. great environment and culture. getting to work on massive scale; seeing how the whole process works; there really is a lot of ownership given to smart developers and teams, with mostly fairly little oversight. you are surrounded by smart and passionate engineers, for the most part, who have choices and want to be there. career opportunities and room for advancement you learn a lot. you work in small teams where you are an owner of your software. this means that you own everything, from writing the code to testing it to deploying and managing your fleet of machines. depending on which team you are on, you will end up working with some cool technologies. this includes amazon web services (s3, ec2, sqs). you will most likely end up writing large-scale distributed systems.like i said before, you will learn a lot. depending on the team, you will not have support engineers or qa people to help handle operational issues and testing. you have to do everything yourself. this is a good thing, in that it gets you into the startup mindset. the name: working for amazon is instantly recognizable. amazon does amazing things for it's customers. you will definately get challenged. there are lots of varying opportunities, some really smart people, and the problems they are trying to solve are huge. the starting salary is extremely competitive. the hiring pipeline is also extremely efficient, empowering amazon.com to court and successfully hire some of the smartest professionals out there. unfortunately, those are the only positive thing i can say about the workplace itself.outside of work, when you aren't getting paged up the wazoo by legacy applications no one in the company has any idea about, life is awesome. seattle is a beautiful city with plenty of culture and no lack of things to do. a nice side effect of working at a place with insanely high turnover and high starting salary is that you end up with tons of young professionals, all new to the same environment and in the same stage of their lives ~ if you're one of them, there are plenty of people to meet and hang out with. you get to work with fantastic people. the projects, in general are very interesting, and if you are lucky enough to work in pacmed building, you can bring your dog. once you figure out the culture it can be very rewarding. my peers are bright, highly motivated people that i learn fromhave improved project management and excel skillscompetitive compensation package. the work culture here at amazon is one

from day one great company, with lots of energy and smart people. i survived just over 3 years at amazon as a senior manager in marketing before leaving for another seattle tech company. the best things about amazon are:1. stock price2. stock price3. stock priceyes, that is somewhat facetious, but it is also entirely true - it is the unspoken truth of working at amazon that nearly everyone recognizes the corporate culture for the crap-box that it is, and that nearly everyone who lasts more than 2 years is in it for the stock price. currently (mid-2017) this is even more true as anyone here currently joined when the stock was much lower and is now sitting on a significant amount of restricted stock.i joined when amzn was at roughly $310, and left with it at roughly $960. i hated most of the three years, but i stuck it out because of the stock until i just could not take one more day of incompetent management, terribly unfair reviews, and a non-existent work-life balance.if you join today, you had better be confident that amzn will be at $2500 in a few years, otherwise you are just signing yourself up for indentured servitude. if amzn is not at $2500 by 2020 - there will be a lot of regretful employees. stocks or shares... pay was ok not the best in the market. smart peopleexciting companypretty good salary -flexible working hours-good resource for self-learning-good explosure in different area work culture is awesome, you make good friends after college, i met great people and who are so down to earth good atmosphere in the company - work with smart people- great hiring bar- scale your career (within engineering)- good compensation growth is very fast and fair chance is given to everyone in accordance to the 14 lp of amazon.good pay-scale as per the marketwork

and after lunch break you do arobics and stretches, which you're going to need...water fountains located all over facility gifts/giftcards given during holiday seasons so far so good. amazon in ruskin, fl is a new concept compared to others. amazon pays well. you will also learn how to be assertive (aggressive) about your opinions, how to work type-a politics, and how to debug difficult code. pay, benefits, overtime and good amount of time off. great pay and excellent benifets bring a part of innovation recognized worldwide no good thing about amazon i was proud to say that i worked for amazon. the reputation of company is well earned. i was afforded travel and business opportunities that i had never had. the company has a fun and carefree culture but is also very metric driven. i learned a lot more about the business world; a pleasant surprise. salary (if you enter as an engineer, have an mba, or hired on at manager level), lots of work, and if you're hungry enough - you can eventually achieve whatever professional experiences and goals that you may want. the environment breeds innovation and rewards intelligence.training and ramp up time depends on a case by case basis. established teams will go through longer and more thorough training, whereas new teams with less than a year of creation will have very little ramp up time (the time it takes to learn a new subject matter can't be taken into account until metrics are pulled from guinea pig teams). a smart question to ask when interviewing in: how long has this team been around, what's the hierarchy like, and how many direct reports will my future manager have - this will give you a better idea of how much 1:1 time you'll get with your manager and learning how to navigate your own path at the company (in the positive direction) felt like i had a lot of real-world impact. my manager was one of few that knew how to treat interns as intelligent people, and gave me quite a bit of flexibility for my project. i'd recommend it in order to grow a career in the future, as i learned a lot. the best reason i like work at amazon is that i have fun and just do my work none that i can think of. there are no pros to working at amazon! amazon's culture encourages changing teams/roles every 1-2 years if you are entry to mid level and every 2-3 years at senior or management level. this culture allows you to constantly learn new businesses and functions in a highly diverse business environment. amazon hires a lot of smart people, whether fresh out of business school or industry all-stars, making it an enriching environment to learn from and collaborate with some of the best talent in the world. amazon gives you a lot of autonomy as an employee, you are expected to own your role and business which often means making high business judgement decisions. i've found this to be motivating and challenging. 1) impactful projects.2) learning new things on a regular basis.3) people are smart.4) culture is peculiar. some people fit in really well, and some don't. amazon's leadership principles (e.g., customer obsession) are real, not some marketing/pr stuff made just to look good. unlike some other companies, i've seen top leaders use the leadership principles to make decisions. we also use them for hiring, promotion, and general feedback. i love working for amazon! i am apart of the aws team. its awesome to work with a highly technical and motivated team. the company culture is like nowhere else. they adhere to the leadership principle and work back from the customer. it's rare to work for a company that puts its customers first and is not concerned with what the market thinks about it. big challenges. bigger ideas and bigger yet opportunities to own your work.speaking up and taking responsibility is expected.customers are at the center of every conversation, every decision.you can and are expected to speak to whomever you need to to get things done.you are expected to try and even fail. failure and invention are inseparable.company encourages employees to explore their career across the enterprise. so you can change jobs without changing companies. limitless opportunities to make a difference. understand the vision and work backwards to make it your reality. build and grow you leadership with influence strengths. benefits you cant beat them anywhere!!! awarded stock after being employed for two years and gain some each following year which are now almost a 1000 a share and thw word is that jeff bezo will never split them.you get personal and unpaid tima as soon as you are hired full time and most the time you can start as a new hire from day one that means benefits as well. i love the company and their mission the work experience is good. people are very friendly. awesome company with great benefits. i met my step goal each day. its better than nothing but next nothing. if you a job you will start part time working 3 to 5 hours a day ot opportunities, great pay and benefits (but for a good reason) great pay, awesome people, hours once you're in the door and doing well, tons of opportunities to explore new areas benefits, family -like environment, plenty of time off 40 plus hour work weeks amazon has great benefits and company culture. great work an environment, loved the job and coworkers benefits good warehouse experience i enjoy the amazon culture and the people i work with. good company brand, stock price rises up. great management and opportunities to work your way up good learning, cutting edge products, technologies, agile, good amount of responsibility, fast paced environment. overall the best place to learn. benefits, plenty of hours, decent pay, decent opportunities to advance in the company if given the chance, cafeteria has plenty of options and plenty of tvs the pay and the benefits keep you on your feet and good pay and good benefits pay was pretty decent. and they always gave incentives and free stuff to try and make you think you were working in a good environment consistent work, very organized, flexible compensation, reputation, professional networking opportunities pay is very good to many long hours. good benefits, full time, a lot of people you can become friends with. - tons of opportunity for advancement, you can apply for new positions or be promoted after 90 days.- benefits and pay are good- great team atmosphere, everyone generally gets along very well i enjoyed the money and opportunities health benefitsperformance based bonusupward mobility possible - amazing people, great hiring process that keeps raising the bar- innovation, feels sometimes like working in a startup, no idea is dismissed- flat, you can talk to anyone in the company- resources - you can get any resource you need if it serves the purpose- self service, self driven, you manage your time, no micro management- very little politics, at least in my view- aws is the leader in its category and will stay this way for a while- they pay well- you learn a lot at amazon you can truly leap! you are encouraged to think big, learn & be curious, grow, exercise bias for action and have real ownership in work that is 'mission critical' and genuinely 'making history'.the leadership principles (which can be found online) are earnestly employed and integral to day-to-day thinking, practices and processes. the environment at amazon holds a palpable energy and excitement that comes from a fervent commitment to hire and develop the best. being among the best-of-the-best, folks who are right, a lot, and being brought together to collaborate and contribute is incredibly stimulating and rewarding.senior management and company tenants impressively insist on highest standards, and customer obsession is a real and seriously held litmus test for all activity! this earns trust and is a huge \"pro\" in my book.honestly, there have been some very dark days that have demanded i call upon personal and internal fortitude to navigate forward, and i am pretty sure there may be more of them in the future. however, the personal and professional lessons learned within those times are invaluable, and i am incredibly thankful for them.the philosophy of amazon is incredibly energizing. i cannot think of another company that is innovating at the scope and scale that amazon is. it is thrilling and a sincere honor to be able to make history, to feel accomplishment for your hard work and i really do have fun while doing so.2 days out of 10, i am regrouping to fortify my resolve and get to work, but the other 8... i am 'tap dancing into work!' very smart people, lot of opportunities to learn from peers. you work with really smart people and learn a lot.you have good opportunity for advancement and growth.people are generally friendly. it is a large profitable growing e-commerce company- great experience to see how a company like this operates. it is in a great city- seattle- with locations all over the country and the world. amazon has a very casual and unstructured working environment. you can wear anything to work! good salary. growth in stocks. good development culture. great business model - customer satisfaction, wide variety of products, lowest prices, and convenience. that combination is hard to beat when executed well. casual dress code is awesome (jeans, t-shirt, flip flops, baseball cap). company profitability and stock price has performed well. the company is finally trying to improve their work culture and make it a decent place to work. number 1 in technology, very efficient in areas such as customer service, and having the products that people want, almost regardless of what that may be. getting to work on new technologies, flexibility in work environment. genius people around you.compensation given to the new developers after working as a college intern at the company i was offered a full-time position which i accepted. as a first-time job out of college i can't recommend it enough; just make sure you're on a team working on an unreleased product. an amazon team in heads-down development mode is an amazingly productive and inventive thing. projects are rapidly prototyped, torn down, and built anew. the build system is bar none the best i have ever used; if you need some library to do something, you just depend on it. done.we had a senior principal engineer acting as a sort of roaming quarterback among our teams and he frequently sat in on design brainstorming sessions. he also sat ten feet away from me, so bouncing ideas off of him was frictionless and really helped me grow as a fault-tolerant systems architect.people wear many hats at amazon and you can quickly make a name for yourself as \"the x guy\" if you devote yourself to being an expert in x. plans change and you can get a golden opportunity in your lap if you're lucky. for me it was defending our system architecture against three senior principals. get your name out there and you'll have other (potentially cooler) teams trying to headhunt you from your current one. i would recommend this strategy: stay on a project long enough to make a name for yourself in some way and then jump ship to another team. a year and a half to two years is a good periodicity for this process.the best thing about amazon is that if you find yourself getting tired of the same old drag in your current position, you can jump ship to another team and work on something entirely new and exciting. this is not microsoft: there is little animosity between teams and no hard feelings will be had. you can be writing servers in java one year, virtualization modifications to the linux kernel the next, and messaging systems in erlang the next.corporate culture is good. there aren't as many hokey ice-breaker or get-to-know-each-other events as in other companies. i once heard the company described as \"having a good drinking culture,\" which certainly was true within my team. our outings were more like pub crawls, with pool and bowling often thrown in as an afterthought as we wandered around capitol hill. good times were had.the pay is pretty good too and i hear the stock ain't doing half bad, too.in summary, i wholeheartedly endorse amazon as a first out-of-college job for people who want to learn a lot about anything. just don't dig down too much in one team and you can rise to prominence in any area you want. within a year i was designing and implementing key pieces of our architecture and my ideas and proposals were taken as seriously as those from people with a decade or more with the company. amazon.com is a great place to work due to its rapid growth. there are many opportunities due to the opening of new facilities nationwide. best work culture environment, friendly management, space to grow, land of opportunities, learn many new things. lots of scope for learning & driving improvement the work environment is good and good career growth good salarypander to the right people and you can move up quickly very good culture and good atmosphere to work a good startup job. but less opportunities in canada work quality is good, u got to code more. innovative minds all together at one place, visionary ceo, abundant leaves, great parental leave policy probably the best place to work for any field, from software development to support. amazon has a great culture and gives independence of work. work/ life balance is good it was really quite nice. 401k and insurance starting day 1. paid vacation and also paid vacation. the pay is very good they start you off at 13.00 an hour. pay is decent compared to minimum wage.hours are set and always the same (until holidays roll around)benefits are good given the fact you get them day one when hired full time. good workout, easy, benefits including health pay and dental. plenty of upt given and paid holidays plus if you work on a holiday you get holiday pay, and time and a half. lot's of vet opportunities if you want to work more hours. flexable hours offered at my facility benefits, stock, relatively fast growth a job to feed my family the benefits. a lot of people need the insurance and it is good insurance. that's pretty much the only good thing here. you understand and value the hard work an amazonian does in order to satisfy every customer. making sure they get their package in time and complete. good benefits and a nice wage consider qualifications needed the pay is decent if you don’t have major responsibilities, but i believe it should be higher due to the 10 hour shifts. the people are friendly and if you like working on your own this is a great job for you. great place to work while they take over the retail industry competitive pay, flexible schedules, overtime. great company to work for i am in better physical shape than i have been in years. if you work hard and are willing to learn all aspects of the facility, amazon will work hard for you.career choice program- after 1 year of service, amazon will pay for 95% of tuition and 95% of textbook costs for a degree of certification in industry related fields. (pretty much anything as long as you stay with the company.)management listens when you have a concise, though out plan.i recommend this job to any and everyone if they are willing to work hard. pay is good. you get in what you put in. plenty of opportunity for advancement. leadership is enthusiastic and helpful.work enough hours and you get benefits. working with smart developers and cutting edge technology. unique leadership quality help to become entrepreneur in future. the warehouse that i worked in was well organized. it was climate-controlled. the equipment was in good condition. the pay was good compared to many other jobs. good benefits, generous time off, free coffee, open management, diverse work place, fair expectations, i would recommend following a career path as opposed to general tier one associate. + opportunity to get experience managing people early on, even if you're new to the team+ solid, smart coworkers+ very fair pay, especially when you factor in the stock-based compensation+ on my team, my hours were pretty manageable+ great opportunities outside of amazon when you leave the place is very comfortable and the training as the effective work is very good. the wage is good. -good compensation- good relocation process-cab facility- food facility great place to work at if you are looking at rapidly improving your knowledge base. very fast paced and dynamic work environment which keeps you on your toes all the time and ensures you deliver. most of them on the business side are extremely intelligent and grounded people who are quite approachable and humble. benefits is much better than average company in japan, freedom on shift and easy of taking vacation is really attractive. lots of genius along the way. you learn a lot in short time. shift timings.... company is employee support oriented... they give preference to employees concern also if it is really valuable they will implement... 1. compensation - amazon pays you adequately2. brand value - amazon alumni are going places3. smart people - you are working with some of the brightest. good salary but no bonuses liberal rules and quite work environment. great working environment, and people around u very supportive of your career path and understanding of the demands outside of work. it is one company who despite the economy downturn, continues to grow and stay positive. the main reason for this is the central focus on the customer, their needs and their interests. another reason they are so successful is innovation, they are very willing to listen to and incorporate ideas from any of their employees. the \"all-hands\" meetings, held quarterly, are fun and informative. the management is approachable and are willing to help with any aspect of your position, whether its corporate questions down to the individual task. you will be given the chance to work out interesting problems with some great people. if you have the motivation to drive your own deadlines and you

environment of online business. highly talented people around. can improve your analytical skill. the business is all about analyzing numbers whether it is pricing, inventory management, or business process re-engineering.many people who left also agrees that they have learned a lot working for amazon.com. the skills acquired at amazon is very useful for working in another companies. the business model of amazon and how you analyze business can be applied to any other online company. many who left were successful getting higher salary and higher job title. i am also one of them. it's pretty cool to work for a company where you can call yourself a customer and an owner. amazon truly does think about the customer first, and all business decisions are generally made with the customer in mind. it's nice to have access to some of the creators of one of the best (if not the best) product recommendation tools. amazon definitely has the power of a large corporate company (along with all of the red tape that goes with that), but that strong corporate brand name alone helps secure meetings with potential partners. the amazon discount is small, but i suppose it's good that you get one! the compensation package, provided you negotiate it at time of getting hired. opportunity to work with the best e-commerce platform out there, and you will learn a lot. great name to have in resume some of the people i've had the pleasure of working with have been nice and very bright. it's really been a pleasure to work with them.having a world class internet retailer on your resume if you are interested in the industry helps to get you noticed. amazon has been incredibly successful (we even had a good q4 despite the economic issues plaguing other companies) so if you do work here you can learn how it happened. you can also see first hand how what works when your small can create a lot of internal turmoil when you get big if it doesn't change. in most parts of the company, people are treated as adults. diversity is valued, intelligence usually wins out amazon.com is really a great company. especially when it comes to how they treat their customers. they really do put the customer first and that is something that is in the dna of the company. i have worked for a lot of companies who say that they put the customer first and listen to what they want and its mostly half hearted pr speak. at amazon.com this is not the case and they strive to make the customer experience better. if you are on the right team, your work will have a tangible impact on millions of people, and as an engineer, it is interesting and gratifying to work on the large scale, difficult software problems. direction is still very much set by jeff bezos, but to his credit he has made a lot of bold but

friendly and eager to help you. they really do become like a family. can get voluntary time off that does not affect your time off allowance if the facility does not have enough work. everyone has a chance to get promoted after working there for a certain period of time. there are plenty of opportunities to get promotions too --- even the promotions at other facilities aren't off limits. there are opportunities to travel for work too, but you'll have to apply for them: as long as you perform well regularly, which isn't hard at all, you will be selected. your regular am and pa will do their

is probably the best thing about working there. you receive benefits on day one of employment. fast paced environment with very smart people. lots of great innovation and ideas on how to perform better hard working people, who work very hard. i can only speak to aws rather than amazon as a whole. and one's experience at a company is at least 50% determined by the quality of their direct manager. so ymmv, but in my experience you will become better at whatever you do.amazon web services is a hard place to work and is not for everyone. but it does have massive opportunities for those who want to grow. we do work hard. if you want a strict 9:00-5:00 job that doesn’t involve being oncall then aws is not the place for you. but if you are an engineer (or manager) who wants to grow; wants to know how to code and own a system handling a significant percent of the world’s internet traffic; and work in an environment where you are surrounded by incredibly smart people who will challenge you beyond what you thought you were capable of, then you should be interviewing at aws. great opportunity once you are promoted. fast paced environment with lots of intelligent leaders. technology, team work, fast pace, better for fresh graudate to get experience fast paced environment where you feel like you are working on all cylinders. surrounded by hard workers who give you the push to be better at the things you contribute. great company to work at as a young professional looking to gain experience in a demanding, high responsibility position. -generous time off benefits

organized. also great perks even for seasonal employees. you get a lot of experience quickly challenging problem space, some execs are not complete morons. very dynamic. people are humble, respectful and very smart. lots of amenities. a very sportive work culture. no pros to think off. there were pros 2 years ago now their is nothing but dirt employee benefit once in a year it is the first company i am working, where employees and business are given paramount importance, come what may be. lot to learn & grow nice work culture, mnc facilities, opportunity to work with talented people.. can learn lots of different stuff really quickly work/life balance is good and the people are good dynamic work (non-monotonus) and start-up kind of culture make me grow and set up career path. because you work so much, you get to learn a lot. amazon pays better than other tech companies, such as google or microsoft. signing bonuses of $50k are common for mid-level positions, and up to $100k signing bonuses occur with regularity. it’s usual half in cash, half in stock grants. the cash is over two years, the stock over four. the start off pay is good for this economy. you have the opportunity to work with some really good people. - good sign-on bonus and initial stock awards- opportunity to work with very large distributed systems (at uncommon scale)- working for amazon web services looks good on the resume- opportunity to get better at operations and how to debug and fix issues more efficiently (although sometimes under a lot of pressure)- learn development from end to end (design to deployment to operations)- dynamic: depending on the team, you will have the feeling of being in a startup but without worrying about having money for your project. its amazon a wonderful company - benefits- rsu's- wear jeans to work very good company to work for. the people are very friendly and helpful. the technique problem is very chanllenge and exciting. easy, you can move into any position without any knowledge. working for a revolutionary company.if you came in when the stock was low -you're in a good spot. if you are coming in now - it's not worth it. the benefits are vast for such a

apart from few things company is growing at breakneck speed. that is all. - several businesses are industry-leading and will continue to do well (amazon retail, aws, kindle)- internal developer tools and expertise is still a great asset a bit of learning... thats it. incredible use of technology to monitor by the hour productivity and product movement! new attentions to ergonomics and automation definite steps forward for a globally competitive company. working for amazon really allows you to get in touch with smart people, interesting technology, and for a beginner in people management, like me, helps you grow a lot. good pay. thats it, if you work the whole 40, (sometimes 50) you can get good pay, but considering the amount you have to walk and stand, minimum rate is not enough. best salary for freshers. happy workplace. salary,sodexo coupons.,cab facility,ac,restrooms,this is too much. offers telecommuting.slackers aren't tolerated. the place is very comfortable and the training

agile environment, flatter hierarchy, greater autonomy for developers comp is good if you got your stock grants when the price was lowindividual contributors are generally solid performers looks great on a resume many challenging technical problems to tackle as an employee. they give lots of room for you to shine but also rope to hang yourself. it's a very dynamic culture and promotes best solution at the time. this could be bad though since it also means a lot of bad solutions are introduced before the best comes out. there is clear career direction and growth which is offered via documents that indicate how to get promoted and what qualities you need.the work environment is a meritocracy. if you back up your ideas with reason, people will listen.there are many opportunities for

tech-friendly. always related with innovation. very motivational and qualified teams. good pay, as a customer, amazon's service is awesome, full of smart people, they are keeping innovating, very energetic environment. nothing to mention about this company great benefits offered including: health, 401k match, stocks, bonus pay program great hours and good pay great envirment and a good location and the pay was great too. pay has now increased to $11 for seasonals and $12 for permanents with part time benefits pay, great coworkers, sense of purpose benefitsgood interpersonal relationsability to grow great benefits, holiday pay, voluntary time off when its slow and double vcp during the holiday season. wage increases are about every 6 months. personal, vacation and unpaid time is available to use as needed. 3 day weekends!!! interesting facility to work in. from my experience the main reasons you want to work at amazon are for the benefits and networking potential. you earn knowledge communicating with others and the job keeps you physically active. customer obsession and is good place to learn none that i seen directly they'll take about anyone. the orientation, paperwork, and all of the not-so-fun stuff can easily be done online in the comfort of your own home. before work, we would all stretch, which i think is very important. our team leaders were really nice, helpful, and easy to talk to. the work could get pretty fast-paced but it wasn't too difficult and i left feeling like i had a nice work-out. the company provided us with catered food for holidays, snacks from time to time, and also gift card giveaways. the pay was average. overall i really enjoyed working here! the hours and pay was good and mangement was great, good location because it was close to home , people were very friendly and supportive of one another. i enjoyed my time there but it was seasonal part time work i wanted to stay but there no available positions awesome company and work goes by fast extremely smart people to work with benefits and paid time off good pay great benefits day one great hours and flexibility. i work 8:30 to 5:00 and am currently not required to work a night shift, which is not common in many warehouse jobs. weekend overtime is often available and you have a choice between saturday or sunday, one half day or a full day. benefits and perks are very good--blue cross health insurance, 401k with company match, stock awards, performance bonuses, occasional free food luncheons, tuition assistance, cash payouts if you decide to leave the company early, ample opportunities for advancement or transfer to other fulfillment centers all over the country. opportunities for temporary transfer to other facilities to assist in training and startup. there is also a great system of voluntary time off--if the workload slows down you sometimes have the option of leaving early or taking an entire day off. that leaves plenty of available work for those employees who wish to put in their full 40 hours. there is a lot of variety in work tasks. you might alternate between working at least six different functions, which keeps the work fresh and interesting and helps to avoid repetitive injuries. smart people. lots of work to do. being in seattle the salary looks good. stock options are decent. high visibility job and a great ownership experience. pm at amazon get to make all the decisions about the product and they are the mini-ceos of their products. quite often the pms present their analysis and road maps to sr. leadership and get close exposure to their thinking and decision making process the best reasons of working in amazon is benefits, stock, and pay rate. you can really make a difference getting to work in all different paths, meeting all new associates, being able to train all associates according to amazon standards, learning new and challenging processes. at amazon you will be compensated fairly well (competitive to other large companies) and have the opportunity to be part of a very unique culture. the stock has been performing well which makes it more difficult to leave. however, the culture of frugality equals less benefits for employees. you have the opportunity to work with very high caliber individuals and be lead by one of the smartest (business) people on the planet (jeff bezos). good pay they pay better than most work with talented engineers, flexible hours, interesting problems to solve. you can be the change you seek although you may have to struggle to get there. business keeps growing and there is always something new in the company that you can take part. work from home. coworkers from various states. great benefits offered by amazon. fast-paced environment - you never get bored at amazonownership - you are encouraged to make changes where you see fit. if it works... great! if not... we'll just try sometihng elsebackbone - one of the leadership principles is to have a backbone. you are expected to speak up if you disagree with something. you don't see this in a lot of corporate environment. you're not just a worker bee. decent pay, smart people, job security. overall it is a decent place to work but it is hard to get recognized for going above and beyond, you really need to talk with your manager on a daily basis. descent paybenefits are descentbrilliant people to work with from all over the worldchallenging environment competitive work place, good salaries decision making is pushed down to the lowest level that makes sense; this gives you the ability to have a big impact. you are expected to speak up if you disagree with a decision or direction, and the discussion/debate will be focused around facts and data, not the seniority of the person speaking. once the decision is made, everyone is expected to get on board, having had the chance to voice their opinion. amazon is an innovator in the digital, web services and

possibilities at amazon. good paygreat benefitspaid time offwhen your shifts over you stop workingamenities in the warehousemultiple job opportunitiesgood exercise amazon's decentralized structure gives teams a good amount of autonomy and freedom to set their own roadmaps and schedules. everyone feels a strong sense of ownership in the systems they build. you are not just a code monkey.the decentralized nature also means that the employee experience may vary depending on what part of the company you work in, so my observations may differ from those of others. (if you're working on base-level functionality such as the order pipeline, you will have different pressures placed upon you than someone working on higher-level or internal-facing features.)one of amazon's core values is frugality--a fact which doubtlessly helped the company survive the dot-com crash of the early 2000s, and should continue to serve it well during periods of economic uncertainty. this adds a nice degree of confidence in the security of one's job.upper management attitude is that we should always be innovating, and based on the features the company has launched over the past few years, you can tell they aren't just using that as a buzzword. amazon is still a relatively young company, so there is still a willingness to experiment.look forward to the mid-2010 move to seattle's growing south lake union neighborhood. we're building a new campus from the ground up. it's nice that they're using employee feedback in the design process.i've seen some headlines that seem to imply long hours (though i can't read the full reviews yet)--fortunately, that hasn't been my experience. it is a great company fast-paced, innovative, breadth of experience, learning opportunities. one of the best companies in the internet space. fundamentally a technology company that built pretty much everything from ground up. amazon.com is the cure for the traditional, command-and-control work environment. jeff and the rest of the s-team (top executives) do an amazing and consistent job of setting and refining top-level priorities while doing everything in their power to empower engineers to be able to just build.there are a wide variety of teams at amazon which work in a wide variety of ways. teams whose software is core to the primary business (selling stuff on the web hello!) tend to have to move much more slowly and carefully, and are obsessed with keeping software highly available and operating at maximum efficiency. the problems of scale are many and from this area of the business comes a continuous stream of innovation to allow the business to keep growing leaps and bounds each year.teams whose mission is less central are free to innovate in a wide variety of ways. with a world-class technology platform powering thousands of distributed services, new businesses and programs come online every day with much less overhead than any other company i've ever seen!compensation for top-performing individuals is extremely competitive. while here i've had offers from apple and microsoft which could not touch it.amazon.com is a global powerhouse with exciting problems being solved all over the world. with decades of growth ahead of them there will continue to be significant opportunity for all of its employees. the initial offer was the best i seen in the industry. the people are amazon's greatest asset. they put a lot of effort into hiring the best people they can find, recruiting is taken very seriously. some of the smartest people i've met have been colleagues at amazon. the energy and pace of growth makes it a really exciting place to work. coworkers are generally interesting and fun people. work environment is casual with a true open door policy, lots of manic panic in the hair of management, and other similar monikers of a laid back internet company culture. you get to work on the cutting edge architectures - webservices, soa, middleware. there's a 360 degree view to engineering where you can get involved with not only the end-to-end sdlc but from an enterprise architectural perspective as well e.g. capacity planning, load/performance testing, senior management reviews and presentations etc. you are a part of a company on the cutting edge of ecommerce technology. when working with other companies you have a considerable degree of clout given amazon's place in the marketplace. great focus on the customer experience as well as amazing efficiencies on the operations side. it is one of the most innovative companies on the planet that never sits back and rests. amazon has a humble approach to everything which i find very appealing in today's world of companies screaming about how great they are.amazon also has an extremely high hiring bar, and the company is loaded with really smart people. that makes it easy to come to work in the morning. freedom to challenge

find the shifts that best worked for me. the managers were pretty engaged and would get on the floor and help if you asked. they pay was pretty good for the work, and their scan rate expectations were reasonable, at about 140 packages an hour. i never found myself below that threshold. amazon has good benefits. maternity and paternity leave is the best around. 6weeks for fathers and over 12 weeks full compensation for mothers. strong culture. as far as the job, mainly deals with yard work including yard jockey, checking in and checking out incoming and outgoing loads. daily inventory of

works on. there are places which are working on old legacy and so-yesterday problems and either re-writing them or deprecating old stuff. same time there are organizations within amazon that work on really cutting edge technology. you get to choose where you want to work. the best organizations also attract the best talent and are the most challenging places to work. the other places are not so great in terms of talent, but it may be a good choice if one is interested in working on relatively safe things and/or interested in a career in management. you can get paid well either way you go

the drive for, and truly in whatever your interest field is, the company will support you. i've been here 2 years and this will by my 4th role. i love it! i've always wanted to be an entrepreneur but the opportunities here at amazon and ability to \"own\" things will probably keep me here forever! no two days at amazon have been the same for me. even when working on the same types of tasks, i've seen, learned, and done new and interesting work.my management has always been customer focused. it's more than talk, they walk the talk.the company is huge but there are always opportunities to do

good pay paid a lot. can move up quick - fast moving company- plenty of opportunities to learn new friends , vacation , difrrent positions great benefits and good pay free coffee and big break room. 1) professionalism: i had a good job while looking for other jobs - a luxury, i know: i could afford to be picky. my interview with amazon web services was done at the same time as two other large companies, but amazon blew me away with their respect for my time, the time they took to get to know me as a candidate, and the quality of questions they asked of me.2) in a league of their own: the professionalism i saw during the interview process transferred into the workplace. everyone i have met as come from a highly qualified place and brings to the table serious skills.3) work-life balance: in my first half year, i have had a pretty good work-life balance. things are picking up, but there is still some balance. i don't mind working the extra time as i am well compensated and

experience.employees are asked a daily question which helps management to build mechanisms to tackle problems/barriers for employees, there are gemba boards where employees can express any urgent concerns and management works on them in a weekly basis, and the job itself is demanding but very rewarding. trms is only for professional people who are committed to help on amazon’s innovation and keep the platform safe from malicious attacks.trms just got a new site leader who is really working hard to improve the employee experience. management overall is very humanitarian, flexible and willing to help employees grow. all managers have their own success story, some of them started working in lower levels inside the company, which shows that hard work really pays off. high performers with great leadership skills are able to be automatically promoted to sr. investigator after one year in the company, which is something i have not seen in any other department or company. these promotions are made in a quarterly basis.there is a recognition program for overtime and high performance which provides employees amazon gifcards in euros, which can add up for a very good sum of money at the end of the month.dogs are allowed in the office, transportation is paid by amazon, there are relax areas, games, 2 parties per year, fun activities, committees for women, sexual

knowledgeable. on the other hand they are not stuck up like some people. you can get lots of work done without playing ego games. there is always something new and exciting to work with/on. for the most part resources are there when you need them. *note: these are generalizations. crappy managers and co-workers do exist*-smart and skilled people-highly motivated people-during any type of \"political debate,\" asking what is best for the customer usually gets people on the same page-easy to move around the company. in fact, it's encouraged.-things are done for a reason-managers seem to be s**t umbrellas rather than s**t funnels.-due to the ridiculous scale of our systems, the one in a billion edge case keeps us up at night-the promotions thing is done on a strict merit basis. if everyone in a department deserves a promotion, they all get it. there is no quota. but each promotion / review is heavily vetted with a bunch of management folks.-i can drink on the job. we have weekly beer bashes and occasional nerf wars. it's a pretty good balance of youth and older, more experienced folks.-management is in tune with you, and what you want to do / are doing. most teams have weekly one-on-ones with their manager to just chat.-management is responsive and receptive - no prior experience needed to join. you don't have to be an expert in distributed systems to get a job. the interviews are also not that tough. if you go through all the interviews posted at glassdoor.com and careercup.com, you should be fine.- great co-workers. team work is really good at amazon and you see heros all around, constantly fighting the madness.- product moves fast and very little beaurocracy (no three month long project reviews, you deploy the code and see what breaks, then fight to stabilize things overnight). overtime almost always available. opportunities for advancement. variety of shifts. it's well known, and you could gain much work experience for your future career plan the people are real down to earth and the pay is decent for the line of work you do. good wages, fun teams, nice atmosphere if it's the only one you can find! benefitscareer choice programopen communication very structured environmentgood benefitsreasonable hoursopportunity for overtime (mostly in peak season) learn a lot, get good experience in your field, work with some cool people. benefits, discounts, pay, opportunities for advancement the only really nice thing i can say about amazon is that it's truly a global company where you get to work with very smart people from all over the world. -amazon reviews the code that is submitted to production, so you have an opportunity to grow as a developer.-my work environment is very conducive to collaboration and constant feedback-i can write code that is handling amazon.com production traffic within a week or two. i feel like what i'm doing is actually useful.-my team has a very high standard for unit tests and other testing strategies, which in turn help you write better code.-very flexible work hours. you can come in at 6 and leave at 2 or you can come in at 11 and leave at 7. you can work extra on some days to get an hour or two off on other days. basically get your work done is the only standard, which makes me a lot more likely to work well.-my team has a large diversity - five nationalities, both genders.-cereal for our floor is a plus! lots of opportunity with ownership, ability to try a number of different roles, transparent communciation great company to get experience in a fast paced operational environment. quickly growing company with tons of opportunities for getting promoted. there is good opportunity for professional growth; there are plenty of chances to lead, and plenty of hard and interesting problems on which to work. also, the company treats the customer very well. it treats the employee less well, however. very interesting distributed system; large problems; can get work done; amazon has high hiring standards. i worked with people i respected and admired.amazon people said what was on their mind. a great example was the quarterly all hands meeting. for an hour or more at the end of the meeting, senior managers would take questions from any employee on any subject: from the company's business strategy to its work environment to its food. powerful technologyrelatively non politicalfriendly culture an extremely fast moving environment where you are empowered to conceive of and champion your own ideas to fruition (as long as they are based on core values like customer-focus). this autonomy can allow one to accomplish a lot and advance. working at amazon is technically challenging. amazon has a very high bar for its employees which results in a company of smart and dedicated people. it is a great place to learn and provides lots of opportunity for growth both in terms of technical skills and in terms of job opportunities. it is very easy to get information about what other teams/groups/departments are doing. i can make a direct impact on amazon's bottom line and customer experience. because you are everything (pm, sde, sdet, build/deployment engineer, support engineer), you can learn a lot. but this comes at a huge cost of sacrificing your life. if you have nothing else to do in life this is a great place for you to kill your time. i am a software engineer, and i love working at amazon. there are a lot of smart people that work at amazon. we are very focused on working on things that are very important to the company's core businesses, but willing to create new ways to expand the business. not a lot of theory, all practical engineering.most of the time, i am driven to complete projects because they are interesting and important. i very rarely don't care about what i'm working on and need to be pushed into doing something. most people that work there can operate independently, and those that can't usually don't like it very much. i am very independent and self-motivated, so i love not having a boss tell me what needs to be done all the time. there is a flip side to that though- sometimes i feel like my boss doesn't necessarily know what needs to be done. you work hard but the people are smart and they are committed to what they are doing. it's great to work with a fun group of intelligent people that are continually innovating and improving. you get to work independently salaryrelocation supportbusiness relationshipslocation of officesperks - transportation options flexible schedules - i worked on a set schedule for 3 months then switched to a pick-your-own schedule. this works great to pick up shifts around school or another job, but is terrible to rely on.the work - it's very repetitive, with just enough variety to keep it from being soul crushing. the repetitiveness let's you become very good at these tasks quickly. i've never been so skilled at organizing shelves, fridges, and paper bags of stuff.active job - this depends on your fc of course, but there isn't a moment of downtime and there's always something to do. this keeps things from slowing down.job variety - you're gonna start with one of the worst jobs at the warehouse (stowing items into bins). if you put forward a little effort, you'll move to other jobs. these jobs might be more physical or planning oriented, and present a more engaging experience.coworkers - everyone is pretty friendly.managers - this is a mixed bag. some are super friendly, understanding, and savvy. others are disaffected, uninterested, and rude. great people to work with! amazing projects you'll work with some of the best, smartest people around. working at amazon is invigorating in that sense; rarely do you meet a 'legacy' employee not pulling their weight. everyone works hard, is engaged, and cares about putting forth a quality product. big ideas are encouraged. you're at the cutting edge of new technology. unlike others, i've not seen any issues with work/life balance. work from home, flexible scheduling, create your own schedule, training is good. great company, great pay,nice benefits the people are different which makes them amazing. you can always count on a co-worker to assist you when questions arise. it is an easy job tired of work but still good if you have no higher education they will pay for some associates degrees. good entry level offerings for hs degree individuals allowing opportunities to make 30k yr. although wont move far from that even if awesome; for years and years due to small variance in pay scales. pay is ok. they have an employee comment system that they seem to at the very least read. they had pretty good food trucks come by for lunch, if you managed to get to them in time. + if you are highly motivated developer, you would love the freedom you receive here. almost no bureaucracy. (being a big company there might be some exceptions but this is been my experience over 4 years). if you are stuck in a team with legacy stuff, or work you don't like, moving is kind of easy (you would have to prepare for interviews though).+ very open env - you could talk to anyone if you have an issue. room for growth and great work experience. fast paced, great benefits, challenging, room to grow excellent pay, amazing benefits from day one, staff is really friendly, monthly activities, easy work depending on what you are doing great benefits, hours, and clean worling environment many great people, and love having dogs at work! smart colleagues, good benefits, good pay dynamic, fast paced, and responsive environment. paid wellfixed schedulelots of overtime offered (not required)good amount of time off decent pay & great benefits. 4 day 40hr work weeks, after 2yrs of working there your stocks are yours to keep excellent benefits, management and co-workers. you work with smart people the projects you work on can be pretty interesting flexible hours off weekends good hours you can bring dogs at work! above average payflexible schedulesthey will hire anyone work closely with managementfairly independentgood trainingexcellent benefits time off pet friendly job not too much to say amazon is the most fun and professional company i have worked for in over 20 years. the onsite district manager and area managers are extremely approachable, proactive, and professional. everyone from the bottom up starts the shift with brief company updates, employee success stories, and group warm-up exercises in addition to other safety promoting tips. the pay is more than fair for a part-time position and the environment is rather fun considering your at work. amazon is great company to work for as control system specialist. good people, monthly bonus, lots of people to talk to, overtime opportunities, chance for advancement, prizes for attendance committed customer centricity, bright people - learn a lot, haven't been bored yet.- smart engineers consistent hours, decent time off, immediate benefits for blue badges. demanding, rewarding, challenging are just a few of the positives derived from employment at amazon. great company to say you work of and it's a huge learning opportunity. generally feel a sense of accomplishment as an owner of a team of people.your peers will be extremely smart and motivated. the standards here are very high and you will be challenged every day. in this job i am never bored, the pace is very fast.you get to work with some of the smartest, most capable people, on the most interesting problems. lots of ownership. for those who like to get their hands dirty amazon can be a great fit. there is room for growth but that all depends on if you have the right management chain. could make your resume look more attractive to the next employer. all pros, there are no cons challenging bar raising fast paced aggressive peculiar is the word. amazon's culture takes time to sink in, but once it does, nothing beats it. love it, everyone is happy. nobody yells or causes intimidation, the environment is quite the opposite. starting pay is $11.75. training is pretty straight forward and nobody fails. i've never seen a job before where they put an employee's needs first. i do enjoy showing up for work everyday. most of the time you get to work alone so work gossip doesn't really exist. piercings, visible tattoos, and colored hair is accepted. fast pace, opportunity to develop and promote. good pay, medical benefits, additional money and gift cards best company to show case talents and completely customer obssessed pay is greatfun collegial atmosphereencouragement to be thoughtful, build your own role, inventwork life balancemerit-based promotions great work/life balance - a lot different than what many people think! always growing, great benefits and work hours. - high hiring bar- your career is

benefits $$, smart people, brand (opens doors when you have amazon as experience on your linkedin) great benefits, no dress code, flexible shift with lots of time off. if you are having a bad day and have enough paid or unpaid time off to cover it you can literally walk out and go home for the day with zero penalty. really smart people, lots of opportunities to innovate, fast-paced i've worked in the tech industry for over 10 years, both in silicon valley and seattle. i can honestly say amazon is the most innovative place i've ever seen. people here are the some of the smartest on the planet, and they want to make big things happen. people who do well here absolutely have passion for what they do, and a relentless drive to do better. they're not afraid of hard work and rolling up your sleeves to get the job done. it's a scrappy, fast-paced environment, and i love that we are not afraid to try something new every day. flexible schedule, great health benefits, stock options. the stock incentive was okay. you had to be at a higher position to earn more shares. they gave the minimum to associates. good income, bonus, stock options, and benefits. but the money is more of a \"bait\" to get you into the company and try to get you to stay for a year with the bonus incentive. amazon has a lot of talented people who always set a high standard of the work they deliver, and are tenacious on pursuing the goals. business is great, there are lots of smart people and small projects, the compensations is enough good and the culture is also great. good job and pays better than any other warehouse here in my area good brand name, good pay. good in the beginning, work from home,some good leads/management, benefits great benefits and if you can last, very good bonuses. * good

time off. many opportunities to own a space and define strategy. feel empowered to do the right thing. earn trust from upper management. the pay is great stuff benefitspaid time offpaid vacation has good benefits accompanied with the full-time job. great benefits, much opportunity for overtime during peak, satisfying work. take safety very seriously, concerned about your well being and always has associates complete surveys. interesting work, smart people, great peers to work with you get exposure to working with a top ranked tech company. they have some cool tech to recruit for that gets engineers excited. friendly environment . ambassadors help out when needed works great with accommodated schedules time off(20 hours unpaid time added to each quarter, pto, vacation, personal and other leaves of absence), flexible schedule besides the managers that in my experience have been difficult to work under, amazon is a great place to work for. most people will complain about the things they signed up for. yes, it does get hot. wear thin, breathable clothing. shorts and tank tops are allowed. get a water bottle and fill it with ice. they have ice machines in the break rooms and water coolers every where.yes, you’re standing for 10-12 hrs. get you a pair of new balance shoes or invest in some really good inserts for your shoes. you get a break every four hours. two 30 min and one 15 min. it takes me two min to walk to break room, not ten like people say.if you haven the worked a labor job before i wouldn’t recommend it. but mostly everything people comeolain about is written out before you even apply. it’s literally in the description of the job. things like mandatory overtime during peak season from november-january. everyone has to comeback in 5 days a week until peak is over. that’s 60hrs a week which sucks, but honestly during christmas, a check every two weeks saying $1,400 isn’t bad. plus you can win gift cards, tvs, playstations and other things just for attendance and or meeting rate.benefits are great. i pay $16 for having both medical and vision for blue cross. i get discounts for pet insurance with nationwide, discounts with sketchers, wineries, cruises, disney, apple and a lot of other places. when you make a year at amazon they offer to pay 95% of your tuition for any high demand career. pto, vto, vet, mto (rarely, but it

don’t have any college degree or other type of experience. 40 hours per week plus voluntary over time every time for those that need the extra hours. amazon has so many excellent internal tools help people develop fast switching teams is easy, managers are supportive. amazon's set of technical challenges are unique to just a handful of companies. thanks to the high hiring bar, you'll truly find yourself working with some of the smartest individuals you'll ever meet. you will be given opportunities to grow your skill set, and your career, and even if you choose to leave the company, you will find your experience in very high demand with other employers in the area.teams generally run themselves independently - this includes defining projects, their priorities, and technical decisions. in that sense, it would be accurate to think of amazon as a collection of loosely affiliated startups, which sometime overlap in scope, with a shared goal of doing right by our customers. lots of hours and opportunities for extra time; good benefits great location and people work hard. good hours pay is ok but was promised more then i receive * great co-workers* love the atmosphere of going to work

infrastructure and businesses across the world, the work you can do has real impact. it's also fascinating to see the kinds of customers we get, and depending on which team you are on, you can interact with some big players relatively often.it is very easy to contact people across the company, almost everyone - in my experience - was more than happy to set aside an hour to grab coffee to answer questions about their service or their team.it's also nice that there are near-constant in-company conferences and talks about various aspects of the company and the technologies we use. certainly a lot of resources to learn about technologies within amazon, and a growing community of people trying to educate about design/ux, mobile, information architecture, machine learning, etc.

and challenge, and the customer projects are interesting, and generally \"hard\", which is why they need proserve.i'm proud to work at aws, and proud of the work that we do for our customers. innovative, fun and exciting!! the best company to recruit for by far. amazon has a lot of opportunity for career and leadership development. i have been here over 3 years and have progressed through the ranks and am finding the leader in me.it is very much an opportunity that can either fall flat, or take you to the next level. jump in with an attitude of showing up every day ready to learn and work hard and you'll get really far. if you are only willing to the bare minimum, or less, than this probably won't be much of an opportunity for you. i'm able to have visible impact on the company and my work is valued. my org has a very healthy work/life balance. i'm able to work on problems at a scale that few others get to. great work environment, upper management really listens and acts on

highly scalable tools that the infrastructure provides. it can be quite the load of work at times, but you are always encouraged to automate and innovate--even when that means tearing out the old stuff you don't like. the whole world is your playground here. if you negotiate well, they'll throw money at you to bring in you in. cause their reputation is so bad no one wants to come here.you'll see how's being in pressure cooker and how to survive if you're amongst sharks ready to bite you every single day. people come to work with a mental sword and shield to survive everyday.company is full of internationals so you'll get diversity, poor guys come here with the carrot of immigration support and then are exploited, hope the department of labor reads this. if they were no tied with

things that i personally approve of and have known to work best for me. the culture of the company fits me very well.in my 7 years, i have not worked on anything that was not of any use to anyone. essentially, no work/time of mine was spent for nothing.managers and senior managers are invariably always demanding, challenging and make you do more than what you would have done if left alone. to slightly lazy people like me, that is really helpful.people above my level are invariably role-models. they have amazing process, excellent communication and influencing skills. very structured thought-process and always focused on the customers. the best place to learn something new challenge and career opportunity. if you need a harder challenge, they will give you one. the company moves fast and is very innovative. they know what it means to be creative. there is always room for people to learn and grow. amazon is a career accelerator. it is a trial by fire, but you will come away being a far better employable individual than you were before you set foot in the door.management is generally pretty good -- on an individual level at least.the company is also insane as a whole. they make very strange trade-offs, which somehow end up working out for them (as noted with the market valuation of the company).the people you work with are competent. amazon has a very high interview bar, and it shows. you can trust that the person you're working with will do their job to the best of their ability, and they will challenge you in return. you gotta make sure you're up-to-date and on your toes, because anything that might be incorrect that you say or do will get challenged and brought to light. great culture, amazing coworkers, and rewarding work experiences. it was the best job i had so far in my career. the best part is the responsibility they give you to impact the business as it is very hands on and a great learning experience. great ceo, great retail side of the business excellent city, really good company the pay was competitive compared to other warehouses and minimum wage jobs in the area.a good place to work during the holidays if you just want extra cash. pay is fair, downtown location i have worked in amazon for 1.5 years.the only benefit i see in working at amazon is you get the brand tag on your head thats all. and yes the fool you around with the salary.and if you are lucky enough you can get 1-2 good intellectual people around you. opportunities for development, challenging environment you work with really smart people and

no pros`, not much to do amazon promotes customer obsession and this definitely filters through from senior leadership down. i have been with amazon for ~6 years and there are quite a few things i like about this place :)-innovative culture: every team in amazon is focused on innovating, it could be a simple process change or a complex technical solution but both are looked upon as exciting innovations.-leadership principles(lp): the lp are part of every thing in amazon be it hiring,appraisal or business solutions. petty much we amazonian live by these guiding principle. in fact i now tend to use them at home too :) (wife is not too happy with that though ;))-a very strong desire to deliver results: every person who has a strong sense of getting things done is highly regarded here. almost all the teams are passionate of what they are doing and that leads to a faster execution.-internal movements: internal movements are not looked down upon here, infact they are encouraged and celebrated. this helps a person like me who likes to something new every few years. wfh available easily whenever required excellent work environmentmotivated colleaguessupportive managerswide

opportunity as amazon is into multiple projects always learning new things and fast.(speed is the key for a company who`is continuously changing. exposure to latest technologies. chances of going to usa work culture,knowledge sharing,benefits. company strictly follows and goes by leadership principles work environment is great. you can listen to music, you can wear anything you like. you get paid for every additional hour you work. you get bonus every year. you get opportunities to earn gift cards every month and awards for your performance. your issues are addressed. you get a laptop which is yours till you leave the company. a lot of room for growth so you can make a large impact on the company even when a lower level position. competitive pay, nice employee stock program (if you make it to year 3), new offices provide a good corporate feel. high growth market leads to interesting new challenges. fast paced. giving employees a fair amount of stock-based compensation. the company is still growing in general. i do like its \"just do it\" culture. decent wages, time off available for temps, paid time off for full time associates at amazon, a developer is like a clown in circus -- must be able to perform all kinds of tricks on acceptable level to get the job done. same time, you will learn a great deal and will understands it end-to-end.for an sde, being a part of amazon web services gives you the edge to work on truly high-scale projects and buys you a free ticket to many other work places when you decide to leave. interestingly enough, right now there is an exodus of microsoft people willing to switch over and work for aws.amazon is definitely not for everyone and requires a lot of effort to stay sane. yes, you will be stressed out almost every day: either being on-call fixing stuff you never seen before (the timer is ticking btw) or managing unrealistic project deadlines or very often both in parallel. however you may look at it from another angle -- this is how people bond and develop trust when they go through hell together. your amazon co-workers will be like your good old army friends forever.on-call can be horrible depending on the team or time of the year but don't create illusions because the industry is shifting the majority of software jobs towards developing and running services. amazon will take you ahead on that and you will learn how it's done on the large scale. as a matter of fact, at microsoft more and more devs carrying a pager too and also staying sleepless (yeah a bit to the east, in redmond.)i like the fact that people don't slack around here and majority of managers are occupied with a plenty of real issues and getting paged too. there is very little of bureaucracy here: know the right thing to do? then go and just do it! you will feel empowered when you realize that you control such a huge fleet. you will find a lot of smart people around you and most of the time they say what they mean.after tasting amazon it is hard to go back to the traditional it company where everything is slow and managers are afraid of changes. if you prefer true ownership of what you are given, you will find amazon a decent company to work for. having been unemployed for a significant period of time it was refreshing to be hired immediately by amazon at their mass hiring event here in phoenix. there is job security in this position if you meet the required expectations of your position. this is not that difficult a task if you are willing to \"work hard\". we are making history as the prototype for all other fcs (fulfullment centers) and at the same time we try to have fun. sometimes this can be difficult with the amount of work that is expected to be achieved during the course of a day but that's the nature of business. overall it has been a good experience and i am hopeful that the opportunities will be afforded to me as i continue with the company. pretty decent salarynice locationlooks good on resumeget to work with some really smart people (doesn't mean they can manage well though)depending on the category, the product samples can be quite nice flexible hours of operations allow work from home via vpn. bringing dogs into the office is fun and makes people smile. if you are a hard worker, and interested in tackling challenges head on, by inventing and innovating than amazon is a good place for you. no one discourages you for political or sneaky reasons, if you have good ideas, and the balls to speak up, most coworkers are positive and will be supportive. some of the best reasons to work at amazon.comgood benifits don't expect anyone to help you drive your career, it's all up to you. however, if you invest in yourself and work hard, you will find that amazon is about as close to a true meritocracy as you'll find in the corporate world.senior management is excellent. they are aware of the details of the business and actively help push the company in the right direction. i'm continually surprised by how very smart these leaders are and how fast they can understand and help solve complex problems. these are not backseat drivers.amazon is not for everyone. you have to be the type of person that thrives in a chaotic environment. every day is a new challenge. there's always some new focus of the week and you need to be able to balance your day-to-day work with the chaos going on around you. if this doesn't sound like fun to you, look elsewhere.people that seize control get control. amazon is not about what level you are or how long you've been with the company or anything else. the only thing that matters at amazon is being right. speak up and back up your position with data and you'll get a lot of \"street cred.\" work culture, goals are driven by process hence no work pressure, very flexible operations, customer, and employee obsessed, always thriving to grow. opportunity to learn new things. great work culture, flexibility in timings best work experience and culture you can get in a professional environment.best place especially for freshers to learn a lot in a friendly work placepeople who come from other organizations also tend to love it amazon takes care of it's customers as well as it's employees. the targets are calculated quite strategically and economically. in the same way, employee productive hours too are calculated with keeping their well being in mind. i love the office premises - its very professional and attractive. the amazon culture seems to have worked really well creating efficient employees and understanding bosses . i think its one of the most challenging places to work, it just gets you to think in a manner that you haven't done before. i love working for amazon. i think i am spoilt for any other organization now:) 1. the culture is aligned to the leadership principles and customers always come first2. great peers3. interesting work which keeps evolving it's an exciting place to work and to show the talent and skills, it has a fast growth oriented jobs, a very encouraging great managers. great benefits, so much flexibility, great facilities with good transport convenience, the good pay and friendly environment with lot of fun activities frequently. starting salary of around 400000 great benefits, great people, great work atmosphere and interesting work possibility to work from home amazon is a really good company, you have the chance to learn a lot, you will be confronted with a fast-growing company that changes very fast and you have to adapt yourself in function of that. 1) opportunity to experience first hand the fastest growing company on the planet.2) learn from extremely talented people - learn so much about building, delivering, and monitoring software- work with tons of smart people- fantastic build and deployment tools compared to other software shops - needs to be great to work at amazon scale. if you think you need a tool chances are someones already built it- your developer box is in the cloud - whatever hardware you need for the job it’s there- decent pay compared to others in vancouver, for the first while anyways- vancouver teams strive to have good work life balance- since your experience is heavily dependent on your management chain and so many teams with open head count, if your current team is not a fit there is probably another team that is. internal movement is encouraged (better to keep you at amazon than lose you)- amazon values arent just words - they live and breathe the values. customer obsession is key.- you’re building at the bleeding edge of the cloud. some really cool stuff at incredible scale gets built, and more often than not you can be proud of what you build - flexible working (most hq london employees wfh 2-3 days/week). most people w/in amg also work remotely from home country often.- beautiful london offices- surrounded by smart, ambitious people from all over the world- tons to learn - be prepared to learn every day- ambitious company - growing very quickly - so lots of opportunity to move internally (e.g. fresh, alexa, studios, etc)- some inspiring mgmt at s-level- company growing so quickly - its exciting/inspiring work environment, amazon culture, people around here, energy, fun, everything is there which will make you feel comfortable happy and let you work towards your goal. amazing place to work. i am loving it.. very open minded culture, great team spirit. the company cleary has a vision. learning opportunity is great in the org. you can be yourself, have options to grow in

me. better than being homeless. it's a paycheck good pay; management will work with me on shift preference. - fast paced- good salary- gives good opportunities- always innovating- value good work amazon is serious about it's business and it reflects in it's employees work culture. teams are mostly independent of each other and innovation gets preference over re-usability. in development if there's need a for particular tool, employees are encouraged to build it rather than search for it anywhere.the fact that employees in amazon treat themselves as owners of the company is probably why amazon has managed to stay on top despite being so huge, employees are free to voice their concerns to anyone and managers encourage them to do so.growth here is exponential. amazon in itself is a conglomeration of several companies (alexa, amazon web services, amazon retail, amazon fashion etc). be it business knowledge or technical knowledge the opportunities to grow are massive.amazon has significant percentage of all the brightest and creative minds in this world. never has been a day in my career here at amazon that i didn't learn something new.if you want to work at a place where you think you can make this world a better place... this definitely is one among them. great people, great projects to work on and a get to learn a lot in a short period of time. i have been around for 2+ years and have learnt a lot and made some really good friends and colleagues i enjoy working with. * people here are great to work with* it isn't the crazy work-you-to-death workplace that everyone seems to think (i was one of those before joining)* free snacks on every floor (different snacks for each floor) company is very strong in its principles which makes it a reliably good place to work.salaries are very competitive full of opportunities every day. maniacal customer focus. you have input into the tools and processes to make amazon better. great compensation package. there is a reason why amazon is regarded as one of the most innovative companies in the industry. the company has a well-defined process for new ideas to be reviewed by the right group of people, and adopted based on their merits, with least amount of bureaucracy during the process. ownership- you get to own and inventculture-fast pace and inventive (amazing)no limits of potentialdogs:)great management no

and managementhealth care good work culture,work life balance,flexible timings within the aws section of amazon in dublin, and specifically within the support area there is a very open nature about the team. you can try, learn or pursue pretty much what you want if it aligns with your long term career goals you discuss with management. management are engaged often, and in direct areas. you ask what you want from them during regular meetings, rather than the other way around. amazon always encourages self-driven career growth, so you can work as quick as you like at your own pace. this can be a benefit or not, as it means if you want something you need to do the work yourself for it, and won't be promoted or given anything unless you build it, create it, do it yourself. the position creates a great place to learn though, and you'll quickly find yourself in demand after a short time here nice place to work clear definition of targets and standardization of daily operations work

able to prove that you can get stuff done, and b) driven to find the opportunities. all you have to do is ask. pay very well with good benefitsallow for creativity. anyone who has a good idea is told to go try it, if it works it's implemented throughout the company amazon keeps making bold moves and placing big bets, and while it may appear to be a sophisticated company that is laying waste to competitors on the outside, the culture is self-critical and constantly looking for new ways to invent and deliver new and delightful services to our customers. if you work for an influential technology department at amazon, it is a fantastic place to learn what it means to launch a business from the ground up - from the inception of an idea to getting a public launch across the finish line. amazon has a high hiring bar with competitive compensation and bonuses, and therefore bright people you can learn a lot from about new cutting edge and large scale technologies. overtime, great benefits, exercise. lots of people great benefits and the pay is better than most places vto, pto, upt, meet new people, benefits pay, start up bonus learned a lot about doing the impossible over and over and over. flexible schedule, work from home possibilities, great experience, ability to move roles frequently. great benefits and stock options. the people are what makes this company great. coming to work is still fun even though there are daily challenges and a high stress result driven workplace. good company to work for. good amount of overtime. 10 hour days but 3 days off. not much to complain about friendly ,nice managers,clean facility,great coworkers a good first job for community college student. they will allow you to only work weekends, collect time off and enjoy benefits. associates that work there are nice flexible schedule, great job for stay at home parent it is a customer friendly company they provide unpaid time off t every 3 month the most fantastic and supportive people you'll ever work with. everyone wants to help you do better and learn. i've been with amazon just over 60 days. the work is not as difficult, at least at my facility, as i had heard and read about. this is a brand new facility and there has been plenty of issues but i would guess that is to be expected. amazon has done quite a bit to engage with the employees...games, contests, raffles, etc. a free pumpkin pie at thanksgiving and a turkey dinner a few days before christmas. we were paid for thanksgiving and christmas and will be paid for new year's day. there is vcp (variable compensation pay) that you get every month if your facility meets it's goal and you show up for work everyday and use none of your upt (unpaid time off). it can be a nice chunk of money. you have the opportunity to sign up for medical, vision and dental on day 1 and the monthly charge for those is cheap. they have more comprehensive medical coverage but expect to pay more. 401k is available and you are to shares of amazon stock which you have access to after 2 years with the company. check the price for amazon stock and you'll see that it's quite a bit of money. vacation accrues with every pay period and you start with 10 hours of pto (personal time off) which also accrues every pay period. upt starts with 10 hours and is replenished quarterly. upt is used in hourly increments so if you are late 15 minutes, and you don;t have any pto to use, it will cost you 1 hour of upt. if you run out of pto and upt and your late that's pretty much it for you. the opportunity for advancement is there if you want to work for it but it is not going to be given to you. show up for work everyday on time and do your work, be flexible for the needs of amazon. it will work out good for you -work from home based opportunity-wide selection of available shifts to choose from-decent pay and overtime shift opportunities available-ability to swap shifts with another co-worker-2 breaks during each shift and an hour lunch break great group of peer leaders pay is $4 more than minimum wage in the state of wi. they have made schedules more diverse. the job itself is pretty easy. they offer free dental and vision insurance for part time employees. there is really good pay endless opportunities as it grows even bigger. great skills to use later on good pay good hours for overnight four day work week. fast paced! everything , career opportunities, compensations & benefits, & work/life balance. it's fun when you drink the koolaid * lots of possibilities to move from department to department.* if you find the right team, you can learn a lot and advance in your career. four 10 hour shifts, and benefits day one.i have been there for 6 months and i love it. decent pay and benefits.lot's of time off offered.some freedom of you are a stower. - benefits are great- room for transfers within the company- pay is fair friendly work environment. interesting project. lots of benefit. the pros include the diverse atmosphere, getting an opportunity to meet so many different people and being able to help people when it is warranted. i love the company and how it takes care of it's employees as well. one of the greatest companies i have ever worked for fast paced, lots of cross team communication and integrations, lots to learn great place to work here it's all in the tag line above. amazon is an amazing place to work, but you will work your butt off.- stock rsus- surrounded by a players- always interesting projects amazing opportunities for personal and professional growth like no other company i've encountered in my long career.this is definitely an intense environment to work in but i've never encountered a company that provides more support and help for employees. the culture here is like none other. the pay was decent that’s all. there’s nothing really positive except for he benefits but it isn’t worth it. don’t do it busy team working environment but not very clean smart people, beuracracy levels are impressively low for such a large organization, many training and coaching resources, everyone wants to be helpful, practically everyone is energized and owns their work. it took me out of being unemployed for three and a half year, not many associates are fired. unless you steal or promote work place violence. you get basic training. honestly i can not give any pros.its too many issues working for that company amazon.com discount, set schedule, overtime available, help with pursuit of education, stock. good benefits safety is a priority lunch room was always stocked with gator aid on hot days they have onsite medical staff . lots of support - roles are very defined - production rates are set for you, hr department to handle all payroll issues - which is very nice stocks and a handful of competent, smart co-workers. you get time off as soon as you start working. good people that work at the patterson, ca fc. that is all that is good about working for amazon none,.do not work here. this place is a bad place tl work. good pay and medical benefits. work from home, paid training very casual, laid back, easy repetitive work. friendly environment, someone will always be willing to help if you ask. you don't need experienced and they trained you to drive differents trucks. great pay, high visibility projects, record breaking speed, you'll never work for a company that has its hands in so many different areas, flexibility to move around and try new things love it here - best job experience flexibility; plenty of hours; awesome training many opportunities to learn and take on new projects.you might get lucky and work with a good boss.if you are interviewing expect to have your bonus split over two years. this is amazon's way of trying to keep people to stay more than a year. the company goes through a lot of people. it's uncommon to find people over 1 year.read the information online about amazon. there is also a website that was created by current and former employees as a warning to people.be aware of this company! salary is competitive, employees are very nice and most stick together work hard, have fun, make history. they work based on the above motto which will be helpful for the employees to grow with the company. great atmosphere, awesome pay, good co-corkers, freedom to make decisions and think outside the box, great hours. leading position in the space aws is an excellent place to learn, be creative, own your project and be part of something larger than you are. pay is ok for fairly easy but boring work. benefits aren't the best, but at least amazon provides something. some of the managers and pas are cool. great paygreat workoutvery lively friendly employees and good benefits. constantly changing environment. opportunity to travel and participate on launch teams for new fulfillment centers. rsu awards (first vest after 2 years of employment, then yearly awards). great place to develop strong leadership skills and experience process improvement, six sigma, kaizen processes which translate everywhere. good salary and got hired when the stock was under $100. competitive environment made it challenging and occasionally fun despite the cons hourly associates accrue 40 hours of pto (paid time off), 80 hours of upt (unpaid time off) and an accrual of 40 hours of vacation for the first year (and 80 hours of vacation from the second year on). vacation time does roll over from year to year. great opportunity for growth and establishment flexible, work from home culture, great innovative events to go, the perks (concert, amazon events, great benefits package, 401k); great place for type a folks, or people who come to get things done; offers great customer service to it's customers -exposure to technology and complex systems-huge learning curve-everyone is required to own and take responsibility-you have freedom to do things your way if they improve work/process-visibility-rewarding pay and benefits-open culture; approach anyone for help;-super cool internal move options either domestic or international transparency, freedom t

other fc's with a very generous stipend! start the day energized and run at full-speed the entire day, making the 10-11 hour days fly by! amazon lives by its leadership principles and the people are smart and entrepreneurial. teamwork and the ability to influence peers is key to success. with peer and manager support, anything is possible. it's a remarkable place to be. aws is the only one providing the best cloud experience and rich feature set so a lot to learn salary and benefits are great. amazon teaches a diverse range of skills, everything from inventory control, packing and shipping, to driving heavy machinery. however, managers worry only about their own advancement and bonuses, not caring much about employees. the hours are only good if you manage to get a day shift of 4 10's, otherwise you have no chance of having a 'life', especially if you work nights; your entire world will revolve around amazon and sleeping. the pay, however, is pretty good. it seemed amazon was a great place to work, while attending business administration courses in college all the professors included amazon as one of the many companies that construed to rise. all of the benefits of working there, great health benefits, and supposed opportunities were misleading. worked on interesting recruiting projects and an opportunity to solve challenging problems. good starting pay ($12.50 for night shift), benefits, lots of time off (also paid time off) you can earn if you come in on your scheduled days, lots of giveaways, 3 breaks throughout the day (two 15 minutes paid breaks and one 30 minute unpaid break). also, if you have mandatory overtime, they'll pay $19/hr for one day of the week you had overtime. it is a job and you get paycheck.pay is okyou can find some great people it has it moments not a lot of pros the engineers are among the world's bestyour work has a visible impactultra customer-centric; everything you do has a direct impact on customers open work environment,

code is available to look at and change, or you can track down the person responsible for it.i've experienced a mostly relaxed work environment with bouts of craziness due to deadlines and big projects. it definitely varies by team/manager.they give you a transit card and will reimburse up to $160 per month of parking.i've never heard of layoffs happening ever. the past couple years have been really booming in terms of new employees joining the company. i've seen two people get \"managed out of the company\" for poor performance. they were both basically given a certain amount of time to find another job before they were fired. both left with another job.i like the location. was closer to downtown with one team and now am in south lake union. there's plenty of places to eat nearby

much as amazon does. in the last 2 years, i have been promoted twice. even though the company is huge, the culture here is like that of a startup. everyone gets recognized for their work. this company is a fire hose of knowledge and is the best place for anyone who is curious to learn something new every day. relaxing, stable, easy, remote, can help ppl solve problems which is satisfying work from home. great benefit and some benefits start at the 1st day. good pay for mindless tasks i really enjoy the fast pace environment. i am never bored at work and my days fly by. my team is awesome and great to work with. great first job out of college! great experience and lot of ownership when employees learn in a faster way and demonstrate interest in their job, ther have the opportunity to get promoted in this company. worked with very talented people. the most complex build system i've ever seen. pays well - lots of money- looks great on resume- challenging, fast paced environment- job

pretty laid backno uniform flexible on time, compared to other warehouse jobs. will accommodate school schedule. good benefits. the only pro is that it pays decent for this type of work -- and they have to, because nobody would put up with the horrendous management otherwise. management and company culture is very positive. if you have a problem or need new equipment while working it is a simple task to resolve. opportunity to be an ambassador and gain leadership skills. friendly coworkersadvancement opportunitiespickup great skills10% discount stay away the scum of the earth fill this place.

for growth within\"). good place for college students before graduation. amazon is a great company, very supportive and the overall work/life balance is good. there are daily quota to meet in any warehouse position, if you are among the top in the warehouse you are noticed. they also offer a one time bonus to seek another career if you are not happy there. i lost a lot of weight working at the warehouse for amazon. their open door policy makes it easy for you to talk to management. better than average hourly rates; work/life balance depends on you; a most bodacious experience; always maintain a positive attitude. high impact projects, good exposure to the industry cutting technology company. exposes you to a lot of new technologies allowing career growth. management is working

campus hires training is excellent; support of colleagues and supervisors is wonderful; ability to impact day to day business rules is fantastic/ smart people, fast moving team, pay is a little bit

environment they offer a lot of personal time off as well as vto (voluntary time off) so you can potentially take a lot of time off work if you want. no one bothers you, work basically by yourself. the app they have to managed overtime or time off work is excellent. they take care of you. they do a lot for their employees. plenty of opportunity to grow with the company. pay and benefits were excellent. you get monthly bonuses if we reach the building goal, i.e. 100-105% to plan. the hours are consistent. first and foremost, thank you amazon for the opportunity. i had fun the first 1 1/2 year. pay is better than most. the break room. the benefits such as medical, dental and vision. tuition assistance after one year of employment. growing business: the company has $150 bn in revenue and still grows 20% a year - many small companies struggle to grow at that rate, but the behemoth amazon does. this means amazon is in constantly hiring and promoting its employees, besides there are tons of rotation opportunities (a practice that is encourage by the way).i like the work life balance. i have never witnessed anything absurd like the media reports, though it is a 500,000 employee company so anything can happen beyond what i can see. that said, my work is pretty much ok, i arrive at 9, leave at 6 and i can easily get personal time off if needed. hourly rate for relatively unskilled work is almost double what the minimum wage is in my state. managers work to make the repetitive nature of the work bearable. fabulous benefit package. work goals are clear and not applied arbitrarily or with favoritism. coaching given when needed. great workout, great pay, good logistics system and fast paced - mature tech environment with tools that don't exist at other companies-

get to take emails also, a lot of emails on slow days-pretty easy once you get the hang of it-less stressful than most call center jobs-paid time off, unpaid time off and vacation time-good pay for call center-good benefits quick training great benefits and time off opportunities. you are in control of your growth. there is a supportive managment team. peak season overtime pay and bonus is worth it. diverse culture, fantastic benefits, a few great managers, easy, if physical, work, decent pay, \"opportunities\" to move up, and they hire just about anyone. smartest people in the world work

people to understand themselves and really work hard to their potentials. also, the leadership principles are so beautiful and encourages to the generation to thing big :) what you do is what you get!

atmosphere, great learning tools. high grade training materials. the pros at amazon arework freedommobilityinnovationleadershiptechnology great people to work with. i've also had a great manager. very open and welcoming environment pretty simple straight to the point you are compensated well and can achieve a work/life balance if you're in the right group. i worked with a lot of nice people. good pay, great benefits. -time goes by quickly-challenging-lots of ot (good if you are hourly and would like the extra cash) a fair rate of pay at a fast, consistent pace for the work being done. there is also a lot of room for learning new roles and moving up if you have a manager that will help promote those skills. the tuition system in place is also amazing and allows associates to grow outside of the company. you'll work on bigger problems at a more massive scale than anywhere on earth.you will have lots of opportunities to expand your job scope and responsibility as you prove yourself. i'm ready to better myself, gain more knowledge, and i'm willing to learn new things that i come across. good engineering experience, learned a lot. big company, so things can be good or bad depending on

comes with sacrifice. - smart people- challenge place- zero bureaucracy amazon is an equal opportunity employer with a rich culture full of values such as teamwork, comradery, and determination. not a lot of politics/bureaucracy. great to work with so many smart people. constant learning opportunities. the benefits are excellent (healthcare, 401k, bonuses), and the best part is, you get them on day 1. also, they grant voluntary time off when it is slow. beautiful, comfortable facility, free coffee. - you learn a lot.- challenged everyday.- you meet people who are smart, driven, and engaging.note: amazon has a high hiring bar, so the people who make it through are 9 times out of 10 fully functional/non-crazy/more balanced/self-aware people. that means a lot of the people here are cool and you want to be friends with them outside of work. aws does it right. they make everyone an equity owner in the business, so you have a vested interest in helping the company succeed. they also make sure you are compensated in a 4 year plan, which gives you the impression they want you to stay. i love that whenever there is a question about what we should do, all you have to think about is, what is best for our customers? that is the difference between amazon and their competitors, amazon is truly customer obsessed and not focused on the bottom line like other companies. good compensation and benefits and opportunities to grow the work is easy 1. opportunities for growth: i started in seattle and after 3 years found an awesome opportunity in europe. i worked with my boss and after interviewing internally i was accepted and relocated. amazon made this process as painless is possible. i've seen many others around me make similar moves to europe or other locations.2. stock: having started 5 years ago, the stock has been a great piece of the overall compensation. i still believe there is a ton of room for growth.3. talent: working with the people at amazon has been humbling. i am still amazed that i was hired given how high the talent bar is here. the interview process is great at making sure we are not hiring \"b-players\" - autonomy- flexibility to work remotely as needed- fast-paced, dynamic environment- things get done here!- encouragement to think big and take calculated risks- all decisions are based on data - numbers do the talking, not some smooth talker great pay, amazing talent, and a sense of belonging. your cohort wants to be there and there is a common vision to work towards making amazon one of the most important businesses in the world. the pay is good and the benefits are good learning opportunity, good for people starting career in downtown seattle.lots of food options for lunch and dinnernice and clean working environment.flexible working time. to provide context, my org is marketplace (the platform for 3rd party sellers). anyways, the pros:- good work life balance. 35-40 hour weeks.- great coworkers. everyone is friendly. nobody has an ego. people are generally pretty smart.- internal tools are absolutely fantastic. engineers can focus on engineering.- lots of horizontal mobility (switching teams, projects, etc.)- managers here work hard to foster your growth and to make sure you get to work on things that you're interested in. fast paced environment, over-time builds your paycheck, holiday pay is awesome. 4 day schedule gives longer weekends. great wealth of resources, but it will take some time to find them and learn to utilize them accordingly. customer focus draws great employees. its a great company. lots of benefits. pay. can maybe move up if you work hard enough. makes me smile. * lots of ownership. for those who like to get their hands dirty -- it can be a great fit.* room for growth. if you have the right management chain, you'll move quickly.* top-shelf engineers. for managers, this makes life easy. no one will stand in your way if you have innovative ideas. you get to build things(depending on the team) the best way that you think they should be. you get to own your mistakes too. hard working people allows creativity to shine good benefits, decent pay, nice work conditions good benefits,lots of overtime,attendance bonus,tuition fees the money is good for the extremely easy work you're doing gave you a lot of hours great benefits and shares in the company stocks, alright pay for the location so many challenging projects going on -variety of work schedules, pick the days/times you are available upon application-standard industry pay for crossdock operations work-great management and associates driven to meet deadlines and break previous goals-prizes and rewards offered for perfect attendance, nomination, onsite service, etc. would like to work overnight shift. company in great location to home. i felt like i was genuinely valued while working there i am in the beginning stages of training but the compensation and benefit packages are the best i have seen for an emt good money good food for events bring your dog to work, good architecture and downtown location benefits, unpaid time off, voluntary time off, paid time off, vacation time, and the pay was good good environment , learned a lot. pay is the only benefit good benefitsown shares in the companyopportunity to advance benefits and the people decent pay. benefits are well covered. guaranteed work hours. work with mostly very smart people, and you'll be amazed at how much you can accomplish in the environment great people (when you are on a good team), flexible work schedule, challenging work, new things happening all the time, you won't be bored since there is so much to do paid time off, voluntary time off (w/o pay), stock (if you can last 2 years) great career opportunities. learning opportunities and career development good benefits plus stocks, good options when it comes to shift schedules you get to work with smart people who get things done. you get to work on cool products. it is nice to work for a company that values their customers. stock options. they pay is great .you can learn different roles in the warehouse. good paygreat benefitsgreat time off options well there isnlots and there is little. i lm not sure what is better. the experience or not. hm ket me tbink most companies have leadership principles displayed that are used when they interview and during yearly reviews. not amazon, they live by their leadership principles. they are used daily as a guide. the benefits are great, supervisors are amazing lots of overtime available during christmas season. here, you can definitely learn a lot and help shape the future of the online business if you like working fast paced business. amazon kindle is an ambitious, forward-thinking place to work. amazon isn't just creating \"me too\" products, but is instead paving interesting ground with new initiatives. it's rare in industry to be able to work on v1 consumer electronics products at huge tech companies, whereas amazon widely publicizes many job reqs for new \"secret\" projects. i worked on the firephone, which although it did not sell well, was still a valuable learning experience and one that has positioned me to more or less be able to get a job \"anywhere\" in tech.the work environment is fast paced, but this is somewhat expected as nobody joins a digital products org expecting to take it easy. the work environment is process-light, collaborative, and focused on results versus process. there's typically a sense of the team solving a challenging problem together and celebrating as a unit. performance reviews are 360, so it's hard to get away with being a jerk to your team or trying to capture glory.salaries are great here. amazon uses a base + rsu's model to determine total comp, so consider the entire package versus base salary. rsu's can be a significant portion of comp, and amazon stock has been traditionally on the rise.the engineering leadership org is expected to be highly technical as well as effective as managers. there's no room for \"high level\" leaders: my vp is probably one of the most technically gifted people i have ever worked with. unlike in some companies where you may have to dumb down presentations the further up the chain you go, at amazon you'll often find that senior leadership exceeds your own technical bar.overall, every company has its pros and cons of course, but the main appeal of coming to amazon kindle is the opportunity to work on something big that you'll be able to actually ship in a fairly short timeframe, and it's something that will often find its way to your friends and family. amazon offers a great tangible experience shipping a product, and is a valuable resume builder. the associates were some of the hardest working (and least appreciated) people i have ever worked with. without these people amazon would be nothing. until the union steps in and gives bezos some heartburn, the fulfillment centers across the country will continue to be glorified sweat shops. it's only four hours of work. the company has benefits for it's part time employees. management is helpful. after only 20 days of employment you receive 10 hours of ato but without pay good reputationgood learning experienceoptimistic future good programming knowledge builds in amazon surrounded but really smart, motivated people. innovative work and cool new products. pay is pretty good for market, though always has you by the golden handcuffs. great pay and benefits. many opportunities for advancement within. having three phone interviews and went to the local office. four hour in-person interview. phone interviews consisted of technical questions and in-person interview consisted of technical and personal questions. high career ceiling. they'll keep you moving up if you have the right drive full time hours and good pay + working with the brightest and best minds in the business+ operating at a scale not found many other places+ focus on customer is key to all decision making, streamlines processes+ access to unreal amounts of data to guide business decisions+ high % of compensation is stock based, which has yielded strong returns over the life of the company+ no ceiling for strong performers+ overall compensation is competive good exposure to work culture - you will learn a lot and grow your career quickly. - always opportunities to take on new responsibility - a lot of smart people to be working with. your experience may vary. you will appreciate every job after amazon. you will never be challenged as much, move as fast or fail as often as you will here. commitment to excellence is very high lots of opportunity due to high manager turnover.lots of stock options and great pay during non-peak seasonalways a project to be worked on, you are never done learning take time off when you need and have hours to.pay isn't bad for the work done.4 day work scheduleovertime available big name company. good platform to prepare for your future career fun and good core values. good place to work at. great place to work, friendly environment.the learning curve you have at amazon is very high.interesting work, lot of opportunities, amazing people and much more. easy to move rolesgreat salary it,s a great company with many possibilities is a pleasant environment i'm an analytical person and i always wanted this place of work great , fun and energetic environment with great systems and processes followed good place to work and growth is exponential. powerful brand, lot of learning and innovation. i have a great experience to communication with the people salary, travels done and training opportunities work culture, most of the managers are caring and understand. stress levels vary depending upon workflow but most of the time is manageable. very friendly atmosphere, great work culture great but enough opprtunities are there environment is amazing and friendly amazon is the best company for all things very good packing and safe delivery products by a delivery boys best company to work as a fresher the reasons to work at is that i can solve my financial problems while working as a part time at home learn how to enjoy work and the environment.communication skills development.employee satisfaction is on their priority list! i definitely agree that this job isn’t for everyone however, it is a warehouse job and that does mean physical labor. the turnover rate is high because a lot of new hires see early on it isn’t for them and that shouldn’t reflect negatively on amazon, if anything i find it great that they hire in bulk, they seem to give everyone a chance which i know a lot of us need. it boggles my mind over these negative reviews, your employer created the rules...follow them or quit? it’s really that simple. benefits rock, atmosphere is great, you do feel valued despite reading that we are just a “badge number,” in reality the badge numbers are crucial because if your family calls in for an emergency they need to know where you are to connect you as soon as possible. they only require 24 hour notice for vacation, you can take pto if you feel like leaving, break rooms are fantastic and a wide variety of food/drinks/etc. i would definitely encourage everyone to apply, you won’t know if you like it until you try. if you excel at your job you are noticed right away, even on the first day. great pay for an internship, and they take you too seattle for a few days which is a blast -) the stock keeps going up!-) great health benefits consistent schedule, 3 days off in a row, great insurance there are tons of cool teams with interesting projects to choose from. awesome benefits and events that are carried out at various throughout the country. i love that amazon is currently the best brand in america at the moment. the stock value is definitely a plus. can get promotedvoluntary time off availableoption to go to specialty department some of the people i worked with are the smartest out there. as a hr professional you will learn so much and gain many skills. you will be challenged to think, be creative and resolve issues every day. if this place is not for you, at least you will take with you the recognition of working for amazon and plenty of knowledge along the way. work from homeemployee discountwork/life balance good salary & bonus if you stay a year.great benefits good pay, decent benefits good work life balance in the team work. lots of it. always. 90% of the people that you work with are willing and offering to work with you to succeed. the other 10% are looking out for themselves and will destroy you along the way. work from home, the ability to laugh about customers who all try to get you to give away the company for the dumbest reasons ever heard. have funmake historycareer pathgood benefitsstocks benefits, dogs at the office, banana stand, young/hip employees, super smart colleagues travel, friendly environment, flexible work schedule lots of smart people; big impact; lots to learn great people business, lots of room to grow, lots of room to influence the business it is very easy money, and there are a lot of good benefits available to all associates including vacation time. this organization never sits still. we are always consistently trying to disrupt the status quo if not creating a whole new vertical. it's amazing to see how nimble an organization of this size can be. finally, the people you work with are just amazing - extremely intelligent, hardworking and understand that boundaries only exist in the mind. none it was the harshest place i have ever worked where the employee had no value you get promoted by chatting with people and doing nothing important. ignore the news article from recent ny times on amazon's terrible work culture. i have been working here since 2012 and yes the first few months was hard in terms of understanding how. what and when to get things done. but once i figured out pace, what really matters and dove in i loved going to work everyday and do what i do.this is a place where you will really use the leadership principles thats on company's page. the culture is open, straight forward, fun and fast paced. yes there is pressure to do better and deliver but what place doesn't have that? i personally find it hard to work in a place where people don't care about company's values, drive to get things done. amazon is not one of those places. if you care you will survive and excel! good benefits, guaranteed 40hrs a week, paid time off , ect big company lots of options / teams great pay. great people. great. benefits and insurance advancement growth i had a fun time do business with and will continue to do so in the future i would recommend it to anyone got to meet some decent people from jersey, when it's a little warmer out its nice ride from philly to jersey the

of amazon's stature if you stick around for 3+ years and wait for your stock to vest, the stock can easily be equivalent to a year of your base pay, if not moreresume builder - you will become a smarter worker beings surrounded by so many intelligent people the lead is very nice good benefits great break rooms time goes by really fast... the ambassadors are really nice and helpful... overtime is available if you need it.. very easy job amazon has good benefits, and they have great leadership principles. it is a company that you can make a career out of, they have every aspect of business. my team was great. my manager was very nice to work with and there was no on-call. great customer service training and cool culture great pay, never short on hours, good benefits, most of the staff is

3 day work week for back half nights 4 days off 36 hours 72 bi weekly nothing great about the company good pay, stock, benefits, opportunities great management, rapid promotion ability. if you're full time the benefits are awesome. fast pace, innovative, young, opportunities. the culture at amazon is amazing. i've never known a company so focused on doing the right thing for the customer as amazon. amazon seems to hire with a strong onus towards ownership, which ensures its employees never say \"that's not my job.\" amazon's environment promotes innovation and fosters creativity with a culture that embraces failure and learns from it. the managers help you learn your job well great benefits, friendly people. fun atmosphere fast pace, learn skills that are valued by other tech companies. pay

great personalities. when help is availible they are greatwork from homeover time during holidaysthe good team leaders really make it. can’t beat the stock. stock price has more than doubled in less than two years and amazon is generous with stock options for management which makes it harder to leave before your vesting period is up. i dont see any at this time i don't know what you're talking about but there are none there is no room for advancement management does not know how to perform their leadership roles and there's always one who thinks he runs the whole show the pay welswas great

anyone and everyone has a voice * interesting problems to solve* really smart and talented co-workers* good pay - the work is easy for the money paid. i have literally done 3x harder work for 7.00 an

case. none of the products are over 50lbs, and you have to manage your own pace.- the personnel are professional and the workplace is professional.- the hours are great.- company provides paid bus

fired, it's because they hire good people. great people, well training program flexibility in timings with the work from home option. focused workforce hardworking & good colleagues great learning curvegood team mates in my experience, amazon's leadership principles guide the company. there's emphasis on working backwards from the customer to deliver value, on innovation, and on technical excellence. there's willingness to take risk, and willingness to learn from poor outcomes, rather than look for someone to blame. entrepreneurial setup where typically sdms do a lot more than people management. they create more ideas, work cross team during execution and sometimes even code. life is demanding is exciting being a sdm and the same time rewarding too! easy jobvery nice people to

learn a lot in your first few months as the company operates in a very different way from other retailers. competitive salary, emerging technology, smart people, dynamic work environment i believe that company has no respect for it s employees nor does it have trust of its employees i felt obligated to show for work not compelled. casual environment. low level of bureaucracy best concept for work, a vision that one could stand behind and be proud of.doing something no one has done before. the best reason to stay here at amazon is the amazon rsu. since amazon's stock is doing so well, employees are getting a great deal from their stocks. amazon hires very smart, reasonable people. while people are a-types, people are cooperative and willing to work toward the greater good -- customers. that said, it is _very_ customer focused with a very strong corporate culture. the technologies available to work on are world-class, albeit it can take time to learn it all as much of it is steeped in tribal knowledge. amazon is a dynamic, interesting company with a unique structure. pay is competitive, but hours are long, depending on your group. interview for the group you're working for, rather than the company itself. there is some room for mobility within groups, but the longer you're in the same one, the harder it is to move around. some groups definitely work harder than others, and some make better software than others. part of something big and generally good - amazon is truly a customer-focused company that has brought some real value to the marketplace. ability to have large-scale impact in your work: stuff i've worked on has been deployed on hundreds of machines and handled $100 mm+ in business. colleagues are smart, pragmatic and get things done. the colleagues here are some of the best that i've worked with in nearly 10 years in the industry. can move up if you become a disciple of amazon. monthly bonus as long as you show up for work without using unpaid time which is basically no call no shows that amazon pardons. i work in afe which sorts and packs the products so i can say my area is more enjoyable then others. i wish this job was around (our site is less then a year old) when i graduated high school as amazon pays up to 95% of a $3000 yearly allowance for school and books for four years after you have worked there for one year. for peak (christmas season) they give out gift cards, tvs, and xboxs etc even though i didnt recieve anything its cool that they did that, but you get alot of overtime in peak so you miss that check in the later of the year. -flexible hours-free amazon swags-get to meet lots of peope like the 4 day week and availability of overtime. the pay is ok and time off is ok. easy to get hired. co workers are decent people. nothing else. none really, they try to tell new employees that they will get wonderful benefits and stock shares, but only if you're vested, meaning you have to be there for at least a year. no dress codechilled out work place the brandpride in delivering to customerssmart people all around youget to experience the feeling of how a fast company is innovating and works from the inside great benefits, smart individuals, and awesome campus and building. no bureaucracy getting in your way to get things done the benefits, pay, and hours. plus fast paved enviroment. no questions asked time off, the leaders have good attitudes the pay is really great good pay on campus, gets to do homework, good manager, good location, amazon brand, does a lot of customer service

was frequently and precisely managed allowing for a great work experience. amazon is a fun, goal oriented place to work. i like to be able to work my own style while achieving results. i am supported in my decisions. great pay and benefits and hours, makes the job much better than it seems. break rooms are always clean and the breaks are great full of opportunities. if you have a good idea, the sky is a real limit. there are so many different business and funding for great ideas. - high amount of ownership- great senior leadership- constantly changing and fact-paced environment - impact: you

anything actually. you learn nothing, they call themselves 'world's most customer centric organization' but do not understand how customer service actually works. have policies they don't abide by. hiring of poor talent at associate and manager level. 70% don't know how to communicate properly, even write business emails. highly unorganized and unprofessional!you may like it if you joined as a fresher because you were never exposed to the corporate world. free of mind. easy shifts,good working atmosphere some teams have good work technical challengesworking with smart peopletoronto has

regular release schedule. we have to get new software out each year before the busy peak holiday season, so we don't have long running projects that end up getting cancelled.i like the small team feel. even though amazon is a huge company i still feel like i work within a smaller team, and that each team can make its own decisions.the scale is awesome. before amazon i wrote software. at amazon

learner. tough work. tough culture. meeting a lot of great people, and always knowing you have work to do. assuming you pick your group properly: great co-workers, fun projects, great products and managment that actually listens. in a lot of ways, amazon's weaknesses are great reasons to work there. it's a frequently disorganized company that does high tech work on a discount retailer's margins, so there's plenty of opportunity to take on complex tasks, self-initiate projects, drive them to completion, and work across groups. one thing that's basically guaranteed is that your job description doesn't cover everything you will have to do, or will have the opportunity to do. also, it's fairly hard to get hired there--their interviewing process is nightmarish--so you do get to work with some very smart people once you're on the inside, and have great opportunities to create new products and drive concrete solutions to complex problems. at the very least, it is a very creative environment.once inside the company, you also have a lot of opportunity to change rolls. after a year, you're welcome to start trying to interview with different teams for new positions, and there is even the opportunity to move overseas for short-term assignments. great vision with great people. better than average quality of employees.: amazon has a good hiring process and the newer employees are all competent. employees are generally devoid of arrogance, which is a common complaint about companies like google.innovative department structure: the two-pizza team structure is innovative and offers a fair amount of departmental autonomy in theory(does not always work in practice) . if you prefer(as i do) an agile developer run process, amazon has the advantage of not imposing counter-productive heavy processes. developers have considerable autonomy to complete their assigned job on a day to day basis, though expect to be blocked ruthlessly and unreasonably if you try to be innovative.developers treated relatively well: you will get your extra flat-screen monitor on demand, no questions asked when your manager wont. your manager's digs will not be much better than your own.weekly tech talks etc. i'm impressed with some of the company values like innovation and customer focus. good learning experience. not hard to move around across groups, laterally though. interesting problems to solve every day, very smart people all around to work with, scale of operations make you push your limits, relatively short lifecycle of projects enable you to see the end results sooner than later, every engineers voice counts if you know what you are talking about. different organizations of the company are like a startup within itself, there are always new technologies being developed, it's fascinating the amount of high tech impact each one these projects has. smart motivated people, challenging work. good pay. good benifits. great people. this company is a very good place to work. if you get a chance to work for amazon.com do it! they get stuff done. there are a ton of technical problems and smart people working on them. you're on an h1b visa and its the only job you can get, or you're right out of college and having a \"big name\" on your resume is worth it. you can find challenging work that interests you good benefits, plenty of overtime

time, on the weekends, because i had another job mon - fri. i didn't have to work overtime. great team-building opportunities for those willing to particpate in extracurricular activities. amazon provides a comforting, independent work environment. decent starting pay, benefits,tuition, casual wear it will help you keep your weight down.they do pay minimum wage.after a year you can join the 401k, but not afford to buy into it.you can set your own hours.they rarely discipline anyone. once you have the job it's hard to get fired for performance.i think 95% of those who apply are hired. after some very negative press about the work culture, many changes have been rolled out that have greatly improved the work/life balance. chee chew in particular has been an outstanding addition to

environment. easy to manage off on emergency work field experience, a history / good time management, a self on going, out standing performance, with conference. i am a man of work. pay is ok , paid time off , unpaid time off , paid vacation , 4-day work weeks (unless they call for overtime) before i begin i want to say that i joined the company as a fulfillment associate in rsp (pick) in the ruskin, fl location in oct 2015 and voluntarily resigned dec 2016 to work at a company closer to home with higher pay (but not as good benefits or incentives). i have a college degree and made a much higher income (in a different field) before joining amazon; however, i was going through a life crisis and needed to get some personal things together.the pros:leadership (managers): this is the big one. my title was fulfillment associate (a tier 1 position-lowest level) and i felt that management supported me and encouraged me. without getting too lame i also felt that the company did not give up on me. i've had a few post college jobs in the past and i can assure you they gave up but this was different. it's a combination of a good company culture, structure and good management (led by jeff bezos).company use of technology: it's a tech company so should have expected but the conveniences are way ahead of other companies. for example, there is an online portal where you can request transfers, check time worked, schedule time off. there's no need for paper forms or to track down manager. the robots used in operations of the business are also all impressive. also can pay for food in the cafe area using your fingerprint.company layout: since everyone has general questions about anything work related (time off, personal leaves, ect) there are human resources personnel in an area that you pass each day and open for any and all questions.diversity of co-workers: there are groups and circles but everyone seemed friendly and cordial for the most part. also seemed to make working more fun and interesting. i made some friends and seemed we supported each other.set schedule and hours: nice to have a set schedule and know when you will be working which provides ability to have real work/life balance.knowing what you're responsible for: tasks are well defined and you can be trained in other areas if you get bored doing one thing. the speed of tasks is important but the average person should have no problems meeting the company's performance goals. you can also race others doing tasks or just compete against yourself and complete individual missions (these games are on kindles at each work station).benefits: 401(k) with company match. stock options. bcbs insurance which is accepted everywhere. my girlfriend was also able to be on my plan because we live together. a lot of other places will only allow dependents and spouses to be included. professional advancement - amazon will pay 95% of tuition for several career fields for you. courses do not have to be to advance career within amazon. basically will pay for tuition to get training to get a job outside amazon (this is unheard of to me). the pay is fair for the area. career choice program which allows employees after a year of service to go to school and obtain a degree or certificate for a multitude of college and professional classes. work from home, flexible hours most of the time great benefits right from day one. promotion from within, education support, stock and monthly bonus, great benefits. vacation time and personal time, unpaid time off from day one. pay, benefits, fast pace, opportinies you will receive health benefits staring day one. full time associates get paid vacation and ten hours of personal time starting out. you also get monthly performance bonuses. great to start career and challenges awesome work culture.good work life balance. easy quick hire ged only $12.75hr/or time half good leaders big impact in terms of numbers, customers, people. good work will be noticed great pay and benefits and you get time off weather it paid or voluntary.might not be the best place to work at but its pretty descent. being able to go from unskilled labor to a pivotal role in operations is something you cant do at a lot of companies; that said you have to seek and capitalize on opportunity for advancement when it comes, and sometimes it might never come. once you begin moving up however, it becomes easier to highlight your strengths and gain visibility with senior management teams. its achieving that level of visibility that is most difficult. benefits. overtime. people. white boards where you can ask higher management questions and they respond right there for everyone who may have the same concerns. monthly meeting where you can speak directly with gm. very innovative, smart people with amazing products and services. learning knowledge, complex growth path pay and paid lunch breaks good benefits on day one. overtime avaiable especially around peak season. co workerd were great but most were young and had very little real world exp. very kind and easy to work with. good pay, good enviroment, good place to be around to start warhouse experience i have worked as an engineering manager at amazon for nearly five years. i don't think i have learned this much in the same period at any prior point in my career. employees at amazon are given a lot of ownership over an area of their product/service. in my opinion, amazon is one of the best places to join early in your career since people are stretched to own large scale projects that help them grow & develop.i have also found amazon to be very flexible when it comes to my work schedule. i am able to work a day or two from home when needed, leave early one day and work late another day to make up for it. as long as you are doing great work, people are very flexible. fun, challenging workplace with room for advancement and varying job duties relating to safety and medical care.

leadership, you can develop your career with amazon. career choice is a wonderful program for anyone that has an interest in going to school. wonderful coworkers (some), outstanding benefits, and decent compensation make amazon a wonderful employer for people like myself looking to further their career. i have managed to find moderate success with amazon, and i've actually had a few managers that i respect. a fast paced workplace for a person looking for a middle step job with benefits. easy apply, you can choose shift, management treats good with employees school tuition after a year,maternity and parental leave up to 4 months * best technology* allowed to experiment and learn eh it was good pay learning is good at the company on sight medical. hr is very helpful. amazon does

room for advancement if you enjoy the amazon environment. people who work there are for the most part okay, the amazon culture is terrible. amazon is growing very fast and provides lots of opportunities for employees' career growth. lots of great people to learn from, a huge internal knowledge base. many different teams with different kinds of work/technologies, easy movement between teams. very encouraging environment for people with a strong work ethic. compensation is better than most in the industry. fast growth opens many positions to advance your career.stock price. meet smart and competent people, excel your leadership and communication skills. amazon has the smartest and most passionate people you will ever work with. the scale and type of problems to be solved are unlike anything anywhere in the world and will give you an incredible experience that can be used anywhere else. amazon is a busy place with a lot of career opportunities. the company is growing really fast and opportunities are available worldwide. internal transfers make it possible to move to a different city where the company is located. fast, easy to get tools, lots of challenges and opportunities, great location you have a lot of autonomy and responsibility. you are given a lot of respect for being good at your job... i didn't find much internal politics (even though i've sure it exists elsewhere in the organization). this may be one of the main reasons that amazon is such a respected name on the the resume.also, the mba intern network is great. there were ~180 mba interns (3x as many as microsoft) from all the top schools in the country (hbs, wharton, stanford, mit, berkley, etc). we all hung out together after work, and i've stayed in touch with many colleagues from other schools after the summer. technical excellence, great leadership by management there is plenty of overtime work to be done depending on the department, the benefits like stock after a year is nice and the bosses are all nice also. good pay, good benefits and lots of paid time off you learn every critical retail function, from site merchandising and marketing to instock management and forecasting. given amazon fast paced work culture, you learn a ton, quickly.i've learned more in my almost 2 years at the company than 3-4 years elsewhere. this is a great place to be if you value learning and want to optimize for learning in your career: the career progression opportunities abound if you perform well. competitive name on resume, intelligent coworkers, fast paced culture where you are consistently challenged, flexible work hours -made lots of money-paycheck every week-was fairly simple work and got to talk with coworkers almost the entire time (while working)-people were mostly cool-good job if you are in decent shape and in need of work experience/money-human resources department was helpful-supervisors were mostly helpful fast paced, cutting edge of technology na; they are not interested in you or respecting the work you do for them. pretty good benefits, guaranteed hours solid pay. work with strong peers the work is easy, you get to talk with other associates and the pay is pretty good. also the job offered benefits. they have great opportunities to earn extra money. most of the staff are nice and friendly and very helpful when you run into a problem. learn a lot here, work with smart people, mobility beverages no cost tome off when system fails great chance for advancement, great management teams, definitely and awesome place to work when they hired me in november for full time i did not know i had to work 6 days a week 10 hrs a day. i just could not do it. but will try to get rehired in january. wish i could have done it. pay was good n 300 dollar bonus at the end n could win all kinds of stuff n benefits. get out what you put in, be prepared to be intellectually tested and challenged outside of your comfort zone in a good way. good work environment....amazon is pretty good about treating their employees well with food and good health benefits and prizes every now and then out of every ten employees i have to work with 7-9 of them are brilliant in their own right (former startup ceos, rocket scientists from nasa, scholars, former pro athletes, academia stars, etc). i've been drinking from the firehose for three years and counting and honestly don't see that slowing down. if you like to learn and really want to propel yourself in your career and industry, coming to a company like amazon (or google facebook, or ms, really any of the top tech companies.,..) is a great career move. i honestly don't see how i'd go back to a middle of the pack company again....so many people leave here at middle level positions, and go on to be higher level directors at middle of the pack companies. its like the difference between playing at a d2/d3 college and going division 1.compared to other companies in the washington dc area, the pay is better and/or on par. because of the stock that you get in addition to the salary, most of us are faring much better than any other position that you'd have around here in a comparable org/role.amazon's way more progressive than most dc area companies - dressing up is frowned upon, people have tattoos/pink hair/etc,...basically come as you are within reason. this removes a layer of stress associated with having to get ready for work, that people really don't realize has a great value. we have pretty good benefits too.you can get hired on and changed roles internally easily. no manager can stop you from transferring. i think this has made managers a bit more nice, as they can lose you easily if they get out of line.amazon is pretty progressive when it comes to skills - they don't care as much about certs and degrees as your abilities. i'm on a team where i'm the only degreed individual, and yet, i do believe that one person, is probably top ten experts in their field in the world, and another person to be exceptional in their skillset as well. the third person has over 30 years of experience and they literally begged them not to retire. that said, we also have many phds and exceptional academics here,..but the key takeaway is be exceptional at making and/or doing. alphabet soup credentials are not impressive here. curing cancer is.so many internal programs to develop technical skills and change career paths. you can come here as an hourly employee and eventually train your way into engineering if you do the work. amazon is a rare company that truly \"lives and breathes\" their leadership principles which drives the innovative & collaborative culture. i can see this displayed in the first week i joined amazon and excited to be part of the largest \"startup\" company in the world where every day is day 1. if you are looking for an unadulterated purpose behind your work, a razor-focus on creating the best products that will change the way we live our lives, this the place. challenging atmosphere, unique experience, constantly changing environment, decent benefitssomewhat reasonable opportunities for advancement, dedicated support staff, chance to make a difference great co workers to be around. making customers happy and satisfied. the culture encourages being open with intentions and playing to strengths. i was an entry-level hire, so growth is probable. pay is not bad and benefits are ok the schedule for work from home was super flex! we could build our own schedules based on the availability the team leads gave us. this allowed me to work another job and go to school. great benefits. annual stock gifts. great insurance. .. they trust you with a lot, allowing you to grow your skills and make an actual impact, even with entry level positions. the company definitely has a direction, and the leadership knows where they're headed leadership principles are great. great company, a good range of work hours to choose from. great environment. benefits package is good. facility is safe. great money along with benefits - work on meaningful products good place to work , good pay huge internal resources to learn cloud

people i have ever worked with. great company with vision and ability to get things done. empowers its people. csr at home position. nice company very friend place to work with great benefits couldnt

based on your passion.\"amazing managers and peers\"the support you receive in launching your career is amazing. if we find passion in any other domain, our managers will help us and mentor to move laterally to other teams or mover vertically to be come managers. company actually makes product decisions based on what's best for customers. decision making is based around rational arguments (usually written docs).people actually follow the leadership principles instead of making decisions based on personal biases. i learned a lot about customer service and worked with great people. and the company culture was promising. great learning experience, good technologies to work on in the middle of a huge industry what doesn't kill you make you stronger, right? flexibility. great company. great co workers, lots of volunteer overtimes, the management are very helpful and the do care about their workers. great place to work. meet new people, dance, have fun it's not fair to base the culture of an entire company on the opinions of a few disgruntled employees. i have worked for amazon for nearly five years and i have never personally seen anyone grossly mistreated, nor have i ever heard of any of my coworkers witnessing such things (and there is no shortage of \"water cooler gossip\" here). i have had great managers and bad managers, but since rotation is encouraged and people are constantly changing roles, you'll never be stuck with a bad manager for long. if you have a very strong work ethic and have a strong drive, you will thrive with all of the opportunities given to you. when i have changed roles/positions, i utilized my network and literally had my pick of positions, even in roles that i had zero direct experience in. my career at amazon is in my own hands and i will milk every opportunity and experience i can get from it--positive and negative--and i will learn as much as i can! the success of amazon.com goes to the amazing worker who make it all possible.

opportunities are numerous. enough opportunities to learn and grow for just-out-of-college graduate.freedom to chose your work, technologies to be used and timelines.opportunities to solve complex problems.building scalable solutions. employee friendly & work ambience is the best thing about amazontreats you well and it;s simply the best to work in. amazon has quite a lot of smart people, and they're given free reign to solve problems the way they think best (after all, they have to deal with the aftermath). the result is a streamlined, low effort, build/deployment system, fairly low bar for building new services and tools, and the opportunity to try new things in a safe manner.the technical environment is top notch, and the important parts are implemented well enough (always some room to improve).amazon is obsessed with metrics - when a service is deployed, part of the process is choosing metrics and monitors to ensure that any problems are caught automatically and fixed; due to the good tools, patches can be pushed out in hours, and rolled back in minutes, so responsiveness is expected.senior management communicates fairly openly; the ceo fields questions at the quarterly meeting, and welcomes hostile or difficult questions, which surprised me. at a divisional level, i always had a good idea of where things were headed and the priorities. the problems you have the opportunity to solve are large and unavailable at most other companies. it's extremely exciting to see your project talked about all over the tech press and to think about how many billions of times a day your code is being run. at amazon someone who is right out of college can easily have the opportunity to design a big system from scratch without being told what to do by other more experienced people (although this is a negative if you are that experienced person having to clean up after the newbie). this of course allows you to learn from your own past mistakes since you are allowed to make them. and, after you eventually leave amazon you'll have that recognizable name on your resume. challenging problems, smart people, a company known for innovation. looks great on a resume. if you can survive at amazon, you can be successful most anywhere. one of the selling points for this job and for the company was that there is a high level of employee visibility. challenging work, very high hiring bar, difficult to get a job there, but once you do, you will be working with the top talent in the industry. many different profit centers within the company (vs. google, which is highly dependent on ad revenue almost exclusively) and lots of innovation, so there are always new projects going on in almost every area of the company. amazon has arguably the best cloud computing environment in the industry and is the industry leader in online retail (both the bread-and-butter of the company), but also does many other things (third party merchants, ecommerce platform, subidiaries such as imdb, a9, etc.). they are very people oriented. both in the way of employees and customers. as an employee, there are so many perks and enjoyable things that make it fun to work there. during the holidays and especially on the cold / snowy days, the management team made chili, pancakes, waffles and other delicious \"warming\" foods. they pass out candy and all other many of treats to keep everyone going on long days. and, as far as customers, we employees are given the tools to really help them. it's not often that we have to hide behind a policy, because our policy is to leave our customer's with a good experience. period. great managers that are easy to talk to. easy work. at amazon innovation and efficiency are prized. amazon's customer obsession is a big positive. the company prefers to invest in long term decisions which are positive for customers over short term decisions which may give the company a temporary boost. while no company is a true meritocracy, amazon does a great job of rewarding performance and delivery of results. you will also get to work with very smart people at amazon. there's always an opportunity to learn from your peers or management. there are many mechanisms for feedback and your job will have a lot of visibility and potential for impact. it's a place where i'm allowed to implement the ideas i have. packageto

company does not remain static in it's daily routine just for reference i've been with amazon working in finance for almost two years at the time of this review.the place has the spirit of a startup but without funding constraints and to me this has been a permanent mba in terms of continuous learning and experiences with top managers/peers. it is a very hands on company, you are the main character when it comes to your area of responsibility and see the direct impact on the business as well as local community of your decisions.the company really puts its own employees first when it comes to career growth/new opportunities. this is a fast growing company and provided results are there you do get growth opportunities as meritocracy is applied. good work,amazing work culture,team

agile methodologies.get to work on projects which have direct impact on the website, you can actually see the code being executed, especially when your code helps the company during thanksgiving and christmas. easy hire, on the spot interviews, started the next day after my interview. pay is above $9. 11 hourly being an on-campus brand ambassador for amazon student pushed me out of my comfort zone to engage with the campus in a way i haven't before. good money compensation and profit sharing it was employment. that is all i can really say about. ownershipindependencedrive your own waysmart people 1. on an avg,you will find quite a few smart people around you ( depends on the team)2. lots of learning opportunities.3. can easily switch teams within amazon.com. you can pick teams working on your area of interest or choose one to learn a completely new problem space/technology. hours that can work around schedule for school. including a subpar benefits package. overall good job to have as part time is the interview process challenging? yes! was it worth it? yes! i love working at aws and am so proud to be here and a part of amazon...i am constantly challenged every day, and everyone is very intelligent. it's refreshing to work here, as i am constantly learning new things (as aws is constantly innovating - it's in amazon's dna) - you will never remain stagnant or complacent in your job . we live/breathe by the amazon leadership principles -- which really do make us all better. this is the reason why there is such a strong focus on the ability to demonstrate the leadership principles in the interview process...because they truly do hire based on your ability to demonstrate the principles. this is also why they interview so many people (1 in 17 get a f2f and only 30% of those who get a f2f get hired - these were the stats i last heard) to get to the \"right\" hires. you will never hear someone say \"no\" - working with other amazonians....it's a very supportive culture that encourages employees to innovate, challenge peers, and strive to be the best they can be. i was status-quo in my old job....not evolving....but here, i am really challenging myself to grow, and that's what i love about it. also i should mention that the work-life balance is great - especially if it's in your dna to work hard and appreciate the challenge...you do have time for family and friends outside of work! incredible company to work for. good benefits, great hours and days to work. the leadership is always there to help you if you are having a problem and the teams all have a great comraderie. everyday i come to work and work on something new and exciting. it's a very good team environment. never feel like i'm competing with someone - just working to improve myself. super innovative, fast-paced, supportive and talented teammates convenient times and pretty good pay. the warehouse is pretty well taken care off and safety is a big deal to them. more experience, exposure and hard work. i chose these because when you work in a ware house or in a company, (a company as great and as awesome as your company) the workers gain more and higher experience and they will get exposed to the kind of work. if this happens, they will be eager to work there more. with this also, the workers will even tell their friends about your wonderful work and persuade them to apply and work there. with this amount of workers and high ratings, your company's credibility will be seen and reviewed as the best company in california and possibly in the whole of united states strong work ethic company were being focused on the customer and working backwards is rewarded. positive business outcomes for the customer is a key metric. fast-paced, dynamic, challenging, exciting, innovative, smart people, great ceo benefits, pay, facilities, dog policy, interesting people lots of good people trying to do a good job good benefits. nice stock grants if you're in with your boss. good company very safety oriented you will work hard, and see the results of your work. good benefits. amazon is thriving so there are lots of opportunities for future career development and their benefits are okay. it was an innovative culture with opportunities for growth within the organization, if you dedicate a number of hours for the company this is a fun job for those who enjoy challenges and who enjoy learning new things all the time. our environment is evolving and growing rapidly. there is allot opportunity to develop and most everyone on each of the teams we deal with is willing to share their knowledge and provide insight for any questions you may ask. there is allot of friendly competition but no real issue with people trying to step over each other to get ahead. people here are expected to be skilled and motivated enough to do their jobs without needing too much direction or supervision. most lower level management have a very hands off approach as long as employees are performing well on their own. pay is good. time goes by fas and training was very good. -amazon has its hands into everything and this goes for all its business units. whatever your profession or career level, you will become experienced with all facets of your job.-great compensation package but also known as \"golden handcuffs\".-you are given a lot of responsibility and control over your department. you have a big impact wherever you are. open culture, autonomy and a lot of learning good place to work and positive people challanging work, you get deep insights lots

policies> best management - culture- team spirit- growth & learning opportunities no one bothers you while you do your job. it is easy to come to work, do your job, and go home. the hours were decent; allows time for classes or a second job. i worked the 5:15am to 9:15am shift and loved it. overall a pretty cool place to work. it can get busy at times, but nothing overwhelming. benefits, time off as you please, non micromanaging i've grown so much in my 2.5 years at amazon. amazon's leaders really invest in the development of talent. they hold you to a high standard and motivate you to go even beyond that. i've heard everything from horror stories to \"best job ever\" stories; bottom line is, your experience will probably vary a lot by the team and position. that said, here are some things i've enjoyed on all of the teams (4 so far) i've worked on:- working with smart people. at every level, in every position, my teammates have been outstanding, really inspiring me to raise my own game- working on interesting problems. there's a huge breadth of work to be done, and finding a team that's working on something interesting has not been a problem. great people over there awesome to be around. this is the most innovative environments i have ever been in. when choosing between amazon and another tech company a few years back there was some bad press out about the company. this bad press actually motivated me to accept the offer at amazon. to me this bad press was intriguing. since working here i have found that the bad press i had read was not at all true for me. i always feel empowered by my team and fulfilled by my work. it was an excellent job, i became a supervisor, worked there for over 5 years, was well paid, worked from home. amazon feels like a massive startup incubator with unlimited free aws credit.i started my career at amazon as a software development engineer intern right out of college. i was given an open-ended problem to solve by my manager at the time who taught me a lot about the amazon culture and how the leadership principles apply to the work we do. i had a lot of freedom to try things and explore other parts of the company, participating in hackathons and attending tech talks.i was hired full time to keep working on the project i started as an intern. as the years went by, there was some turnover but mostly a lot of growth in our team size. after a few years, my manager of the time left and i was offered to step up and lead the team which i am still doing to this day. since i took over, i hired enough people to quadruple our original team size. i believe that amazon is one of the few places where you can be trusted with responsibility so fast and be given the freedom to run your own internal startup within the company. pay, benefits, managment, hours, schedule learnt a lot working at amazon. interesting work, full vertical ownership in the team and freedom to define and execute on your own milestones. high visibility, exciting workplace full of high intelligent and driven people great pay. casual dress code. overtime opportunities. holiday pay is great as well. it's a face paced environment which means

working here. opportunities to move up are available. compensation. interesting problems. lots of autonomy. it's a great paying job available over time and good benefits they will hire just about

international company homely atmosphere with friendly peers it is a big company, lots of internal opportunities; lots of talented people were trapped in first and then treated poorly. it has good

basis which is really cool.c). paid time off 6 days. pretty good. 3 sick days. okay. the leadership principles are actually important to the culture of the company, and not just some nonsense written on the wall. also, integrity, hard work, and a customer centric attitude are rewarded. reputable company in retail or distribution you get to say you work for amazon i have learned, and continue to learn, a lot of exciting, fun, and cutting edge technology. amazon web services is at the forefront of public cloud computing and as such is inventing tomorrow's services and capabilities. almost everyone i've encountered is willing to share their knowledge and experience. even though amazon.com is a company of over 100,000 employees, aws feels like a startup with high energy, excitement, and buzz. the company is obsessed with customer satisfaction. bureaucracy is kept to a minimum. the cadence of releases is daunting, but exciting. initial signing bonuses are lucrative, but subsequent payouts sub-standard. amazon has its fingers in lots of pies. it's well-positioned to lead in many areas by it's slow, but methodical approach. innovative company, diverse workforce, great location great flexibility in work hours for management, telecommuting options, base salary and opportunities for new innovative ideas. pay, results achieved and interpersonal interactions bezos is a genius. he invests in new ideas and takes risks, not just for a moment but for years. long enough to see if a new piece of the business is financially viable and fits with the rest of the company. the company takes a long-term view with its overall direction and performance. quarterly wall street response to earnings is not driving the management and that's a model all could learn from. competitive attitude to resolve problem and learn new things not many pros. the stock price is really high which makes my salary pretty high but my co-workers are not getting close to what i am currently at.

progression i didnot find any negative . friendly environmentdifferent departments to develop knowledge -great benefits-internal transfer oppurtunities-good managers opportunity to grow was there no timings is the best thing. we can work from different city while the team which we are a part of can be at a different place. growth is credited to the team in which you work. there are a lot of teams where you will thrive. but you can also find teams where most of the work is already done. that is to say the team is well established. in such teams, you need to understand the existing architecture and then can take up new projects. in such teams, growth will come with time. although both have their own pros and cons, but it depends on the individual and his goals for the future who may be inclined to new teams as there will be a lot of learning and most of the things they have to build by themselves.people are of very good nature. you will find extremely talented individuals near you. you will learn a lot in a very short time frame. work environment is very good.fun at work. great working culture, managers and team good people and work-life balance pay and benefits. 4 day work week. sick days and holiday pay. monthly bonus based partially on attendance. able to work in different departments, good health care, always overtime compensation is good. you will work with a lot of experienced managers to learn from. i learned a lot after two years with amazon. the money is good i guess keep in mind, all of this is the experience of a senior engineer in a particular group. ymmv.+ everyone wants their product and amazon in general to be the market leader. the idea of being an also-ran is totally alien. i can't overstate how great it is for morale for everyone to be so driven.+ you see the effects of your work. no matter who your customer(s) is/are, the company makes sure you are connected to them.+ an endless number of difficult problems. even pedestrian engineering tasks become significant at amazon because of the scale.+ demandingly high but realistic expectations. people at amazon are smart and competent, and they expect all their coworkers and reports to be smart and competent. you'll rarely feel like one or more bad coworkers are dragging down your team, and on occasion when they do sneak in those coworkers don't last long. similarly, management isn't in the habit of passing down impossible edicts, because they get called out and pushed back about it when they try.+ transparency and sound, if not perfect, corporate strategy. i've never once been told \"do this because i said so\". there's always reasons that can be traced to actual needs and desired outcomes, and unless it's an experiment there's typically good data to back it up. amazon doesn't operate on whims, nor does it waste time on petty vanity projects that can't be shown to provide significant benefit.+ a weird combination of stability and flexibility. the company is doing well, so if you're getting your job done there's no chance you're going to get laid off. promotions are by no means easy, but not as difficult as some make them out to be, and it is very easy to move around at the same level. it's hard to feel like you're trapped in a dead-end job.+ competitive compensation and benefits. amazon may have been lagging in this regard historically, but they've definitely caught up. the compensation structure is a little strange and some people view it as a reason to quit after two years, but i think that's the exact intention.+ great workspace. the buildings don't have much in the way of flashy extras, but, given that they're in the middle of a major city rather than off in the burbs, they don't really need them. the offices are comfortable and more spacious then i've seen at other big tech firms. the location has lots of good stuff to eat and do within a short walk. bicycle cages and locker rooms make bike commuting a breeze.+ awesome internal communities, both for work-related and non-work topics.+ good work-life balance. i put this last on the list because it's the least certain. if you have a good manager and take managing your own work and time seriously, you should have no trouble excelling without having to put in extra hours. i work fewer hours at amazon - not much more than 40/week on average - than i did at companies that have better reputations for work/life balance, because employees are more empowered to make and manage workloads. - great place to work, at least speaking about my specific team- excellent benefits- excellent work/life balance- paid leave is a great pro great pay and signing bonus. exposure to new innovative reporting and lean processes fast paced and well known company to work for. very famous company and very cool technical stack. day one benefitsflexible shiftscompetitive wages it have a lot of benefits able to get your hands on some latest technology. seattle is a great seattle, way better than bay area in my opinion. smart coworkersat amazon you’re going to work with some really bright individuals. everyone i work with is very intelligent and very hard working. that’s evident by the clock ticking down to 6:00 and seeing all your coworkers typing still at their door desks.interesting workthe work you do at amazon is already quite fun. on the retail side it’s like running your own business. there’s so much to do and you’re never bored with the work. it’s neat to see how everything you do impacts your business and improves it.casual work environmentit's also quite nice that you can go to work in jeans and a t-shirt. bringing your dog to work is great also, but really it's just a wait to keep you there longer. there is no shortage of overtime hours if you want them. safety is obviously important, and while it's appreciated, usually seemed to go overboard in its enforcement. somewhat flexible with time off (paid and/or unpaid); but beware of running out of your allotment (even if unpaid) = instant termination! ownership: amazon gives employees a lot of ownership over the projects they are working on.career growth: there are tons of internal opportunities for growth and you are able to drive you own career trajectory. compensation and benefits are very competitive.work life balance: i heard some of the complaints about work life balance before joining amazon, but in my time here i have not experienced any issues with work life balance. the work schedule is flexible and i rarely take any work home with me. * very competitive compensation* widely recognized name on the resume* intelligent employees* good engineering processes great co to learn interpersonal skills great benefits, great pay, great hours, fulltime / parttime hours, discount, wonderful health services i get to work on very visible, customer-facing projects that make a difference to thousands of people a day. my management cares about my career growth and work-life balance. i am paid very well. interesting problem spaces, dynamic environment, excellent focus on customers amazon makes you feel important. comparing them to ebay, is like comparing apples and oranges. it’s a company that’s grown and continues to grow. that’s a company that i would like to work for. well-defined job responsibilitiesgood exposure to online retail selling pipelineenables

building great people to work with smart people, data driven and customer focused. challenging work environment, never bored, talented people, fast paced. everyone works hard or harder. you get exposed to the newest technologies. you push yourself to be at your best. i worked on interesting projects. this internship was what i would expect as a software engineer. also, the pay is very good. the hiring process is quick and simple. they hire lots of people to fill their many open positions. they do not your previous work experience. they just need bodies to fill the positions. perfect job for young, energetic people just getting out of high school. amazon offers an excellent benefits package for it's employees and there is some room for advancement. always hiring, easy to get a job there. pays better then most entry level jobs. possibility to move up to tier 3. great benefits, decent pay.supervisors, and coworkers are very friendly.they look out for employees great pay, one of the big fives on the resume to show off. from my experience at other large tech companies, i'd say that amazon stands out as being challenging. at other tech companies, you may have more vacation days. at other tech companies, you may have more perks. what you are unlikely to have at another tech company is a role which allows you to stretch yourself to the limits.i've repeatedly heard and agree that at amazon, you'll have a role similar in scope to a role occupied by 6 people at microsoft (for example). you'll have to drop 80% more things on the ground to be able to stay sane considering any reasonable person would say a team should do the job you're doing solo.on the other hand, this means that assuming you are (or become) great at time management, you get to have influence over a significantly larger portion of the company than you could otherwise.i'd also say that amazon is significantly more excited at getting into every type of business imaginable. we have an extremely active process for any good idea which can lead to \"sure, we'll fund that new business\". take all the aws services for example. this is much more true than was my experience at facebook or microsoft, where it was significantly less likely to move forward.i also feel you have a great amount of control at amazon over your personal work experience. some people work 12 hour days, always say \"yes\" when new work comes up, and they're surprised when they end up burnt out. others can work consistent 8 hour days, still move their careers ahead, yet have learned those crucial prioritization/\"no\" skills. working from home, working odd hours, doing internal extra-curricular activities/projects.. all within the control of someone who's excited to be involved and do things.career growth is only limited to your own abilities. i've seen over the years some great people rocket upwards in the company, always being stretched by their management chain because they've proven capable of taking on more. i love that amazon is growing so much (across so many types of businesses) that it is up to an individual to decide how/where/when they'll grow their career. the values by which amazon runs are simple yet powerful. the culture of \"always focus on the inputs\" and \"innovation\" is what makes amazon innovate year after year. it is worth spending a few years at amazon to understand and learn this culture.scale is mind boggling. definitely a learning experience.people are extremely talented and smart. lots to learn from colleagues. interesting, fast paced environment that will push you. benefits. great pay and good benefits steady paycheck biweekly, and a lot of mandatory overtime great benefits from the beginning nice office, dogs in the office, compensation is very competitive, very smart people working there paid every week-always work available. well the culture and the way things are handledwe need to speak out our basic concerns and its always taken care off challenging, interesting, best people to work with good people, challenging work, flexibility to work in any team/ project which you want. no work pressure as long as you aintain your quality no one is gonna disturb you. everything is good. if you are interested in supporting cloud customers then this place is a heaven for you. you get to troubleshoot variety of issues of the customer amazon hires great people and tries to unleash their full potential. i feel i've accomplished more in 4 years at aws than in my entire previous career, yet i also see there is so much more i can do here. amazing work environment and it is a very challenging job. good for those who want to grow in finance. good pay if you work nights and plenty of overtime oportunities.full-time 40 hour contract which is a rarity nowadays3 days off a week.easier to become permanent than in the past.company shares(for now)...easy to change shifts if you have children or education commitments.carreer choice program which pays for your studies (if you have time to study and work full-time lol).staff discount.holidays and sick pay. growth opportunities - transparency - culture people are friendly, free coffee, pto, medical/dental coverage for blue badges good team, learn a lot technology in a short time, good manager and mentor. have a lot of fun with the team. also seattle is a good place to live and work. amazon offers me a very interesting project. the mentor , the manager and the team are very good. amazon is an excellent organization to sharpen your program, project or operational skills.amazon is a great place if you are a self starter that needs no guidance and who loves the opportunity to take an idea and build it into the next online service. air condition facility, nice break rooms easy process and friendly people ambitious place to work and has motivated people amazon is a \"can do\" place. people who are ready to work hard, be courageous, banish self-doubt, and fight can do well. even for those who find it hard to be aggressive, amazon will surely benefit you and help you learn new skills. opportunity is there for the taking, but no one will coddle or encourage you - ever. it's a tough place, but it pays well and gives you lots of opportunity. smart people to work withgood company -> competitive environment-> you can switch teams easily and pretty

impactcompany has a strong focus on action - get a lot done amazon is a place were you work next to really smart people who are motivated and excited about what they do for a living. while our workforce has changed over the years, the culture instills a focus on knowing the details of your business, maniacal focus on the customer - even if that means short term and perhaps long term pain - because that is the right thing to do and a willingness to take risks. people who love change and deal well with ambiguity thrive at amazon. those who want to be told what to do and who desire a clear road map get very frustrated. every job has it's ups and down and amazon has had it's fair share and more, but the company continues to innovate, continues to eschew the trappings of success and the employees take pride in their work. amazon truly values the customer. there were a number of instances where amazon would do something which short-term wasn't good for the company, but was definitely good for the customer. bezos strongly believes that doing the best for the customer will also be best for the company long-term. career growth, ability to impact business, ability to make a difference ability to lead initiatives since management ranks are lean. it is a fun, fast paced environment. lots of opportunities to advance with the rotational program which really gets the creative juices flowing and moving between teams. people are highly motivated and want to change the world, very serious about the company mission. everyone is treated with respect and team environment is great. relaxed work environment, i can chat with anyone around me and listen to my music, then go out to happy hour after work with some coworkers. truly a start up. although a big company amazon still enjoys a start up environment, you will quickly get responsibility over diverse areas and will have a unique learning opportunity at amazon.com you have flexible work times and the option to work remotely (as long as it is in moderation), and the managers are very supportive. these have been important factors for my performance, since i feel that i am most productive when i work without disruption.in my opinion, the best aspect of working at amazon.com is the fact that you have immediate impact on customer experience. the projects are usually short (on the order of weeks), iterative and deployments are painless, making it quite easy to innovate and get instant feedback. this also means that you get to work on a variety of projects that stretches you on different levels.teams are usually small, which fosters team spirit and sense of ownership. you are always judged by your merits. your opinions are heard, and as long as you can make the case they are most often adopted.amazon.com, today, is more than an online retailer: it has variety of other services to offer; like amazon web services. this means, there are a large number opportunities to advance your career in a variety of aspects -- without you having to change your company. and, did i mention that you will be working with some of the top engineers in the industry? focused on the customer and creating a good expereince for them. there are opportunities to work outside us if you want to spend some time working at elements outside us. most of the survivors are an intelligent group that try to believe in what they are doing. amazon was a great place to learn and hone skills but an incredibly stressful experience overall. it's nice that they really do put the customer first, and i will continue to be an amazon.com customer. excellent medical/dental benefits, good pay and interesting work. knowledgeable onsite techs and great to work with big company with a startup culturelots of good people working.work life balance is manageable.customer is the priority. overall amazon.com does provide good health benefits, stock, and tuition reimbursement program. the pay is also ok could be better but that's with mainly any job. opportunity for advancement is also ok first if all, as with most big companies, your experience at amazon will vary greatly with your business unit, and your team. mine are great.i work in the kindle org, and overall it's a great place to work.the work is definitely interesting, i've worked in backend systems where the challenge is reliability and dealing with big data.the work-life balance is great, and i almost never spend more than 9 hours at work. when i do it's almost always because i'm working on something that's really interesting to me and i just want to get more done that day.i really buy in to the whole customer centric thing. we really do make choices that we thing would be better for the user (than the alternatives) even though it may be more painful for us in the short run. the energy & excitement of working for amazon can be contagious. there are some interesting perks for employees. pay can sometimes be better than competitors the people that work there good base salary with the opportunity for career advancement. the pace is fast and the learning curve is steep. excellent stock options as part of compensation. if you can

large well-known, well-thought-of (by customers) company. it was one of the only places i've worked that i didn't have to explain to people what we did.my base pay was decent and benefits were good.

managers. showing pride in your job will get you better positions quickly. structure and thinking - there is a lot of document writing at amazon, in case you have not heard. while some people do not like that part of the job much, i think the required meetings and documents force every employee to truly think about their job and what they are doing. producing the write-ups and getting them ready to face up to a room of very detailed scrutiny and questioning forces you to think through every aspect of your business. it is really a very valuable skill that amazon does a great job of developing.

rewarded for that. theirs alot of friendly co-workers.. but have no time at all to speak with them in less your on a break...or lunch... the money at amazon is good and you work alone essentially. peak time offers a lot of overtime one month out of the year. -working with intelligent and driven people-exposure to interesting work/challenges-lots of room to grow as a professional-ability to maneuver between different teams/orgs-compensation is good challenges, ownership, the opportunity to roll out brand new technology 1- there are countless opportunities available to you.2- every

politics. my fellow coworkers make it easier as the day goes by.there is room for growth within the company.they have other things like career choice if you want to obtain a career outside of amazon.the health insurance is amazing4 day work week. opportunities abound! like most large companies, amazon encourages the movement of employees- laterally and vertically. lower level positions need only apply to open positions to get offers for lateral movement without even an interview! we have access to all open positions around the globe as well as access to the self paced training materials to help prepare us for the opportunities. the benefits are good, the environment is too and we have plenty of opportunities to voice our opinions. great community of colleaguessmart peoplefun- hard working environment stock, variable compensation, personal tme decent pay for hours worked off the top, if you stand your ground from day one you'll be taken care of and (1) earn what you're worth, (2) get the projects that will make your name. benefits, fast-paced, promote from within, perks during busy times of year, incentives to excel. the majority of the people were nice. i learned of new products. the day flew by as i was always busy. they offer voluntary time off in addition to sick days. there was opportunity for overtime. peak season came with rewards and give aways. give great hours. some nice people employed. some are rude. good company for someone who is open minded and driven. multicultural work environment. a different problem to solve weekly if not daily. convenient scheduling. short sort shifts which are relatively easy. work is not hard at all. a lot of efficiency at the sort center. excellent people to work with.fast paced. collaborative yet

it's amazon's lifestyle!!!major room to grow and navigate to other positions throughout the company. smart people, good design practices, great offices. managers were amazing! felt like they really cared about your future at the company. fun company culture. no facetime culture, function mobility no micromanagementdefine your own terms the discount is ok, but that's the only real pro you get paid good to be bored. people are friendly benefits from day 1, but good luck getting day 1 great pay bump compared to ems (you will also likely receive a hiring bonus and a rsu award), full benefits which begin on day one, lots of opportunities for professional development provided you're willing to take on safety responsibilities outside of administering first aid (not mandatory but if you want to climb that's the next rung), 4 on/3 off schedule of 10 hour days divided into front half (sun-wed) or back half (wed-sat), fun coworkers, lots of autonomy.if you're burnt out on working ems, have gotten over wanting grizzly trauma cases, and don't mind working in an office setting this is a great job for you. if not you will likely be bored. you will be required to have your state ems license or your national registry certification (a recent update) but understand that you will not actually be working as an emt, and amcare (the name of amazon's in-house first aid program) is not a licensed lsa. you will be treating people at the first aid level as defined by osha (which is very limiting compared to the road but more than adequate for the typical cases you'll be treating onsite). you will also have a lot of autonomy and there will likely be times when it's just you on your own running the show. when you're not needed in the office you'll be expected to walk around on the operations floor and interact with other employees to help drive the safety culture of the building. if you're self-motivated, a quick learner, and can complete tasks without someone standing over your shoulder constantly you'll be just fine. if you're the type that tends to procrastinate until the last minute you'll find yourself in over your head very quickly. pay and hours are great lots of free stuff amazon offers you the ability to hop of department to department as long as you work hard in your current role. there is opportunity for ownership, invent, scale money is good, 3 day

-lot's of autonomy.-decent compensation-an attempt to keep amazon from being driven from the top down, like lot's of big companies. it's actually partially successful.-if data is available it rules the conversation, no matter what the rank are of the people involved. i'll take data driven over ego driven decisions any day. amazon is a very data driven environment.-because amazon has such a large

out, you will love the position. the pay and the health benefits i made a decent amount of money working there. good pay, work overtime whenever you want i get to witness some good software processes that help to ensure work quality.you are encouraged to voice out your thoughts, opinions, but of course back it up with data and constructive solutions always.there are endless stuffs to work on; challenges to overcome, unchartered work that no one has done before. if you are one is a self-starter, one who strives in \"no one know this, you have to figure out yourself\" situations, you got this.take it in a positive way, there are many problems in this world that no one has a clue how to solve. someone has to take it on head on after all.i cannot say much for the rest of amazon, however there is no talk down approach from management in my current team. counting my blessing on this.yes, we are frugal, no free lunches but we have occasional friday happy hours, team activities to bond us.most importantly, we get to meet some of the smartest, hardworking folks in amazon. great environment, and people. you really get to learn and grow i learned so much and was challenged everyday to work smarter! treat people good at first flexable hours, great team leaders, best management around, happy environment, opportunities to move up the corporate ladder if your a dedicated associate. training provided i learned a lot. amazon treats interns as full time employees - so you get hands on experience what the work force is like instead of only working on a project. amazon is an ownership company. you are responsible for determining the requirements, building software, testing it, and monitoring and maintenance. if you like having the power to make decisions and build things your way, it's a great company to work for. the schedule is more flexible than some jobs, and you don't need any experience or gear to start out. the clothing policy is also really chill, so you can wear whatever you want. the pay is comparable to other jobs in it's class. energy, levels of learning, smart people wonderful company with huge goals. incredibly talented coworkers make this place an amazing place to grow. work culture, weekly happy hours -awesome coworkers; they keep a really high bar, at least for sdes. ownership is a real thing; not just management-speak. every sde gets to own the entire service/product and has insight and input into every step - requirements gathering, design, development, deploy and maintainance. this is particularly true in new or relatively young services. each service is also independent of each other. in most aspects, this leads to a startup culture within the big organization. at the same time, being a large organization allows great shared platforms and technologies to be used by all the mini-startups within the company. being full time, you do receive great benefits--health, paid time off, vacation time, etc.you get to work with a lot of different people. and get to know a lot of people as time goes on.as well there are times to do culture activities. some good people working there so you can network and meet people that might help you with your career. if you get a position where you enjoy the actual work, you will get to do it all the time so if you love what you do, there is no shortage of work. it is rarely dull. there is good opportunity to work on your portfolio/experience etc. palletizing, stacking totes; so easy a monkey could do it; for the most part, you won't lift more than about 30 lbs...not that heavy.as long as you make rate, you are left alone for the most part.most employees are very nice and respectful.the job pays extremely good money for such easy work---especially night shift4 nights a week (off-peak) opportunities to influence change are abundant. continuous change, so if you don't like something...just wait around a bit. lots of ot during the holidays. amazon offers great benefits like stock shares when you are full- time. always busy so hours aren't and issue and competitive pay raises**! you receive a raise every six months then they are given annually. quick and easy to make money with a seasonal position. working to create new digital experiences and new platforms is cool, get to work with some smart people, brand recognition of amazon is great, stock price is doing well. benefits are top notch for the area. compensation is competitive-- as long as the stock price continues to climb. turnover is high so there are plenty of opportunities for promotion. in the fulfillment centers controllers work with a high degree of independence. amazon is always trying to improve the way they do things. as an employee, i like being made a part of some of these decisions. amazon's healthcare benefits are amazing and i would be hard pressed to find another job with comparable coverage. diy attitude. the compensation was good. people were very friendly. company is very competitive as far as wages and benefits. they offer good hours and regularly offer overtime. they treat everyone fairly and getting hired or promoted is a sinch if you work for it. i have never worked for a company that has such a strong culture on saftey and customer obsession. they do a good job at giving credit to the associates and put them in the spot light. smart people, fast paced environment, lots of opportunities to learn at amazon the perfect is not the enemy of the good. it's a place where one can produce good work quickly along with a plan for incremental improvement that moves toward perfection.lots of resources means that although amazon may be behind in an area; when the business sees that something is important, it can ramp quickly to the status of parity and even as a pace setter. lots of ownership. lots of latitude to resolve ambiguity in creative ways. rsus are super! relocation! cash bonus at signing! royal treatment during recruiting! great pay, nice people and extremely good environment. as a mid 20's male with a bsc and msc - this was everything i wanted and more professional career growth great work place good camaraderie with fellow colleaguescareer development advice and good work ethicseverybody is pushing for the same goals centered on the customer (big difference with microsoft). promotions are gated by well written promo guidelines with focus on delivery, and impact, not on internal politics. people spend less time campaigning for their own promotions (seen cons). much better healthy relationships between teams/orgs/people. top performers are heavily compensated.” there are none...i would rather work at mcdonalds then this place what a zoo... there is lots of opportunity for career advancement if you are willing to put in the work and study amazon's core leadership principles. the fast paced days makes time more bearable. the benefits may be a pretty penny out of your pay, but it is worth it when you need them. stock benefits are a bit plus. your voice may not be much as one sometimes, but amazon makes sure it hears their associates in numerous ways such as associate surveys and round table meetings. in general good place to work. lots of exciting stuff team work, wonderful people who work hard great people, interesting work, large cool factor associated with working at amazon the benefits are the only thing amazon has to offer growing company which allows for growth both informally and formally through promotions. one of the few places that focuses more on the results an employee delivers without letting their age get in the way of opportunities earned. work with smart people, culture of innovation, ability to influence results, customer focused the peak pay 21$ hourly and 25$ day bonus plus won tv fast-paced, off-the-cuff development strategy.all ideas are open to discussion and even trial runs.short release cycles and updates in response to customer feedback.adequate compensation and stock rewards.high-caliber people in most positions. + brightest people+ freedom to innovate great pay, numerous hours to work, etc. amazon has an amazing infrastructure and platform, which can facilitate the development process and make your life easier. you can work with a lot of people who have strong technical background. people here like to share their ideas. also, amazon provides a lot of opportunities and facilities for employees to learn. if you are an engineer and you want to choose a company as the start of your career, amazon is a good choice. work by yourself for the most part. --creating, innovating, and inventing are highly encouraged and supported--a reasonable amount of time off and/or somewhat flexible hours (some groups)--conferences, videos, trainings to help further your career--fun events, such as company picnic, concerts, and film screenings--dogs!--relocation packages (for some positions)--located all around the world--transportation passes innovation - get to be part of a great company that's continuously innovatinggrowth - company is growing at a rapid paceopportunities - with growth comes much opportunity to expand your skill setexcitement - with the rapid pace of how we work, you are always learning and never have a chance to get boredwork life balance - you are encouraged to own your own

and lead initiatives. many dedicated individuals that work hard to deliver results challenging work and amazing colleagues. its blends the fun of working in a start up with benefits of a large company. excellent benefits, great people and environment benefitsset scheduledpay is good10 hours shiftemployees very friendly there are lots of good people working hard to make a living nice

freedom to move between teams and disciplines- good work life harmony (if you know how to say no :)) vcp, vto, time off vacations since i started engaging with hr about a systems engineering job i noticed a special warmth about the people at amazon lab126.the in-person interview with the boss of my boss went very well and the next step was the on-site full-day interview.the people at the full-day interview were kind, caring, interested in my background, and how i have solved problems for customers. i talked to both managers and engineers and i was very favorably impressed by all the people.after the full-day interview i felt well about the prospects and got a job offer that i gladly accepted.now after almost five months on the job and i very happy to be at amazon lab126. i have already traveled to have a face-to-face meeting with a remote team in europe that i work with every week and everything went very well. all the people there were warmth and interested in what i have done and what i am doing now.the work is very interesting, clearly relevant to my background, and i am supported by management and co-workers in items that i am learning as part of my work. stocks, vacation, lots of days off exciting company, great pay and sign on bonus great benefits, interesting work, nice atmosphere, good compensation, amazing coworkers, nice office and nice location in bratislava. benefits are good and the company is flexible decent pay. good benefits. flexible schedule. all thoughts are just my understanding. there are many positives:1. significant growth in almost every direction (of which are hundreds) the company goes to, which means:- that amazon becomes one of the best places to \"design\" your own career path without leaving the company. actually, the company encourages employees to move horizontally, as they are interested in us staying and finding what we want to do for life inside the company. ads, finance, operations, fintech, hardware, cloud - these are just a couple of things you can choose from if you want to work in amazon.- easier career growth.- \"winner\" brand in your resume if you decide to move on later down the road.2. very smart people with diverse backgrounds around you, which are all interested in developing each other and directly give feedback. especially if you have an access to vp+ level meetings, you have absolutely incredible learning opportunities, as the senior management (people i interacted with) is outstandingly knowledgeable and experienced.3. from what i heard (have no actual data to support it), less politics than in other companies. i feel like people are super busy implementing improvements (as there are so many of them) and thus \"expanding the pie\" instead of dividing a small pie they have now. my feeling is that everyone understands that expanding the pie is much more rewarding in the long term.4. leadership principles, which create a very good framework/guidance for all these absolutely different diverse initiatives (amazon is like a set of many startups) to operate and interact with each other. because of that, the whole structure is very well managed without micromanaging. pay is decent for fairly easy work. easy to get hired. simple, but physically demanding workset schedule every week i love my co-workers. i work at a distribution center and the people i work with are great. the benefits are decent even as a tier 1 employee. use work there last year people were vood work for and hours don't have to explain when your late. you just get time deducted from your accrued time you get. there are so many types of good people there. they usually let you try any job if you ask. water spidering is one of the most active jobs. you are going back and forth to the elevator for freight and have to keep the stowers sleds full which can go empty quick because they have rates. water spiders also are opening boxes and bringing back gaylords when they're full from all the empty boxes. lots of lifting totes, product and definitely a work-out. other jobs with a lot of walking are the problem solvers that fix the stowers items that have something wrong with them because theyre going from station to station. jobs where its active because of rate but a lot of standing is pick, stow and recieve. i have done recieve also and its more fun than stow because you're not waiting on the bins to come and there's more thinking to that job than the others and more steps to it. whichever job you do, it's a pretty positive environment with a lot of fun you can get involved in. its either a job for u or its not at all. its the only job where i can leave with out explanation if you're not feelin it that day or have something to do. you always get good hours here. you can wear what u want pretty much and they give stuff away like swag bucks where u can buy clothes or other items from their store and food in breakrooms. playing with cool toys and new equipment. good paygood benefits such ashealth care insurance, 401k amazon is world leader in cloud computing. it is useful to learn how things are built. coworkers are nice as a whole clear goals and

pretty easy if you stay on task. amazon is hiring everyday so you meet new people everyday. many different job task opportuities. great place to work. but have to have flexibility to work any shift.

things- lots of spending on r&d the company itself is always growing and therefor always room to advance, in theory. if the culture is actually held up like it is supposed to, then nice place to work. the stocks are very nice as well! if the company ran how bezos dreamt up, i would never leave. very high level of talent; fast-paced; performance evaluations are based on real data available in real time; still a young company with high growth and lots of opportunity; good pay and benefits it keeps you so busy. amazon is a top-notch place to work if one is looking for myriad skills and experiences working in the world of e-commerce, not only for personal development but also as a resume builder. additionally, they do maintain, in my opinion, a very clear and positive focus on creating \"the best possible customer experience\". that's a philosophy i could easily get behind. also, amazon encourages employees to move around a lot laterally, which means that if you don't like your role, it's always possible to find something else internally. also, given the intensity of the work environment, people leave on a regular basis, creating openings for you ladder climbers out there. a place like start-up. creative and dynamic it's good money and not too hard. - people want to work for amazon. the associates hired by amazon want to take ownership of their work and their facility.- the pay is pretty good. high starting salary, sign-on bonus, first year retention bonus, stock options, and a 401(k) match are all very enticing.- opportunities to move up and travel around the world are available. stepping up in the company typically requires a move to another part of the country (or the world). there are plenty of fulfillment centers around the us and it will continue to grow. salary was satisfactory, but not worth the headache. there's a reason the \"work hard\" part of this company's tag line is first... you're going to work hard. but if you love what you do and have a passion for the innovative, always-pushing-forward culture, this could be a good fit. wasn't really an interview so it was easy good company, with good salary...till the stocks increase good company to work for and to be apart of nothing at all they are liars who will say anything to get you through the door. i was told i was hired for day shift just to find out i wasn't when i had accepted job and had left my other job. they said wait 3 months and transfer and when i did they denied day shift transfer. hr is a bunch of liars. i can't think of any (extra words for space la la la la la la) it is easy to get hired by amazon. the work environment is clean and organized. there are many managers to help with training. nice company, people there are amazing the pay and hours were perfect for a recent graduate they have decent pay and benefits. benefits are decent fast hiring process. the job itself is great i like that im actually working for my paycheck. great and open working culture its one of the best companies to work great place and work culture amazon is world largest e-commerce organization. friendlyno restrictions about dress code i moved to amazon from another multinational corporation one year ago and from my personal development, it was the best move i could have done. the environment here is really challenging which makes you constantly alert and it pushes you towards your best results. i definitely feel i have learned more in this one year than during the whole last years with a different employer great environment, feedback based company.benefits (transportation, amenities, insurance, compensation, etc).skills and knowledge gained. this is a constant mba - i do not need to look for anything else outside. more chances to work as a team,work environment is pleasant to deal. feels good to work with a multinational company, has different benefits and it is time to time job. they would pay for overtime if they expect you to work more than usual. opportunity to work on large scale projects that have a global impact. amazon constantly innovates and looks for ways to improve on what we are already doing. work with smart people (which everyone always says in the tech industry) and have the freedom to make real changes. fast pace, never a shortage of things to do. pay is competitive but unique to our culture considering the lack of education or experience required for the position, the pay is respectable. there are many opportunities to take time off or pick up hours. dental and vision insurance is provided. the process by which you can utilize your pto and upt time. benefits and decent salary, education reimbursement none, seriously. i cant think of any company is always innovating and it encourages big thinking. excellent benefits - growth opportunity pretty straight forward tasks. easy to get along or follow a particular work flow fun place to work, well paid it's a strong name to transition to pretty much any company you desire after and is highly desirable on a resume. dogs at work is also life changing if you have fur babies and the medical insurance is great. good working

creative in problem solving- generally, a very cohesive work group.- if you want to work on cutting edge stuff, this is the place. tons of resume value. trust me, folks outside respect the amazon talent. salary - pay appears above average however you more than earn it! * compensation - overall compensation, if drawn out over four years and averaged per year, is above average - especially if the stock performs well. if you get an offer and do the math, this will seem like a small fortune. the medical benefits are quite good compared to other companies, my premiums were very low. * reputation - when you leave amazon, you will find that having worked there carries weight with other companies due to its success and reputation for only hiring the best (true or not, perception is reality). * opportunities to move - if you like to move every year or two, amazon is expanding rapidly and always asking for current managers to move. * business - amazon is expanding rapidly in order to accommodate growing demand. you will not be downsized or laid off. opportunity to work on massive scalability problemsworking on forefront of online retail on global scale business modelability to

potential of work is classy. great work life culturebest package in the marketlot of benefitsstock options for l4 and aboveoverall satisfied employment for any individual transportation: very safe place for women employees in terms of transportation. i would say the transport is the best here in amazon. if the women employee is the last drop for the ones doing shift between 11 to 8 and 12 to 9 and post that, an escort will be allocated and ensure we reach home safe.dress code and culture: when it comes to the dress code, you can come to office in any fit you want. very nice and friendly environment on the floor.work: work is always challenging here. its very interesting and you are welcomed to invent and simplify and come up with lot of new ideas. there is a very good growth here and

managers flexibility of working from home, love the company, discounted shopping, and the medical benefits can't be beat. sometimes there is also voluntary time off that you can sign up for that does not take away from your personal time off balances. you get the opportunity to work with very smart people, make your own strategy (as long as it meets the company's goals), always new things to

overtime, paid holidays, easy work work from home flexible schedule helpful and productive engineers everywhere challenging, fun, good people, a lot of opportunity to move up with no college if you put in the time and work. good benefitsgrowing stocksgrowth opportunities are really good decent benefits, paid time off, always work so no worries about being short on hours, paid holidays, and you get a small employee discount focus on communication: amazon does a good job communicating at the employee level. at many large comanies, the sheer size of the company means things slow down. amazon does a great job focusing on communication tools to ensure information is disciminated as needed. use of email, ocs, irc, multiple ticking systems, and ancilary tools to find people help ensure information can get to where it needs to be now.ownership of tasks: each department has authority to do what it needs to do without excessive input from management. even during major issues, regular employees can make the call to execute large scale solutions without having to go to management for approval. teams themselves own day to day tasks and are responsible for them, often operating as a small business within the company . this allows each team to support their internal customers quickly with out office politics and meddling by multiple levels of management.learning ability: there is so much to do that after 1 or 2 years in a position, you are encouraged to move to another department if you so desire. this allows you to take your current skills, build on them, and grow into a new job. however, if you decide to stay put, technology changes so rapidly that you'll be constantly learning new programming skills, new operating systems, and new tools.management of poor performers: up or out. it's that simple. not performing, improve or you're gone. poor performers cannot hide and are not tolerated. managers have to fight for their employees every year and explain why everyone is valuable and should stay. if you don't perform, you'll be at the bottom of the pool and looking for your next job.knowledgeable co-workers: although amazon does not focus on education but multiple factors in hiring, it seems as if most people have advanced degrees. not just that, but everyone is a super-star. if you think you know all there is to know about your job and are the top person in your company, amazon will show you there are plenty of people better than you. that provides the drive for employees to learn, grow, and improve.focus on employees: of course, this depends on the department as well. but, most departments do a great job of focusing on employees. many jobs can be stressful and hectic at times. but, management takes care of their employees. some teams have a cereal breakfast bar available every day, a friday afternoon happy hour with food, beer, and wine (yes, in the office!), and quarterly fun events / outings. this is in addition to the director or vp walking the cubes just to pop in and say hi and see how things are going. excellent team work, safety number one great benefits; easy-going, understanding managers; you get a raise every 6 months as a tier 1 associate (aka entry level position); monthly bonuses for every employee; multiple shifts; they allow you to switch shifts/positions after 90 days in a position 4 day work week is great - working on innovative, cutting edge technologies- being part of something which will affect millions of people world wide- being surrounded by the most talented, passionate people in the software industry by far the biggest pro is the stock price: stock tripled while i was there. also, at amazon i had the chance to to work with some of the most dedicated and hardest working individuals in my life. this can be good or bad, but i am putting in the pros: everyone i worked with at amazon is very smart.if you work incredibly long hours after a few years you may get promoted. and if the stock price is moving in your favor, this could be a big chunk of change in your pocket. * good experience for a junior recruiter looking to learn the ropes -- suck it up for 2-3 years* great for an agency recruiter to make the transition to corporate* the business (in theory) has ownership over the recruiting process ((in theory, recruiting is not a back office function)* take your dog to work* the pay is okay, but you have to negotiate for it (including an additional week of vacation in the first year. and go for a high salary because you won't want to stay long enough to get your stock.) retail and search are good . they actually work on developing new features and lot of opportunities to work on cutting edge technologies .amazon highly focus on perl - mason , java .many systems are already in place so you can reuse existing system and work on developing new features . very good monitoring tools and great place to learn if you land in right org . dynamic environment and valuable experience amazon is a great place to work. management does a great job of engaging associates. get hired if you can! great growth opportunities. everyone is encouraged to be (and is) customer focused.willing to try new businesses, even if the opportunity is/looks small at first.great pay, mostly because the stock price has been going up so fast. * the startup mentality at amazon gives you the opportunities that you can never expect at other organization*they want to see if you will sink or swim*independent work atmosphere working four days and having three days off. like working the overtime during peak time. positive and friendly work environment. - a lot of interesting projects- proposed compensation was well above that i expected- i've got my green card in 2 years after first day- great ceo with very ambitious plans data driven decisions, no politics. merit rules. everyone loves by leadership principles. once you get set, there is no better place to work. not really very many pros working for them anymore. they have good benefits but monthly bonus and give aways and discount has dropped. amazon has been a good place to work overall. company growth is outstanding and it is great to be a part of some groundbreaking initiatives. the pay is fair and i like the compensation structure. once you are an employee it is easy to get visibility and move into other positions if you want to take your career to a different field. amazon is a great place and company to work for as long as you work under certain area managers. great pay but you do have to work for it because again it's not an easy job and anyone can tell you that. we get a monthly bonus(vcp) which is based off attendance and performance. we get a discount at 10% which is better than nothing. they offer a career program were they will pay for a certification or degree up to $3,000 for 2 years which again is better than nothing. i love working for amazon overall because the benefits, pay and monthly vcp we receive. expectation is that all your waking hours will be spent working. you don't have to think about any other nagging life issues. you meet some nice people in amazon, and the training process is easy and laid back. there are few other pros. excellent work culture, on time salaries, good bonus you get one big name on your resumeknow how they work (whether you like it or hate it) 1.free food

are astounding and brilliant. the product helps the customers like no offering i have ever been a part of. a trully game changing set of tools and solutions. pleasant environment.often freebies, snacks, food... etc.they seem to care about customers the best part about amazon is its focus on ownership. you really have the opportunity to contribute to your project, and in more ways than just \"here's the feature, code it up\". you get to think of how you want to improve the project and are encouraged to do so in anyway you can.there's not much to say about compensation and benefits. they're around average, but i still list it as a pro.free snacks in the kitchen. i have great coworkers and like the type of work i'm doing for now. its been 18 months since my last review, and since then i feel that things have been improving. amazon started coaching managers in how to do the associate's jobs, and that has made it easier for them to understand problems and help make solutions. our management in the areas of outbound where i work has been great and they have been very easy to get along with. i have been employed for nearly 5 years now and it seems that in the last year and a half more emphasis has been placed on quality and safety than in years before.there has also been a more postive outlook among the associates in my area, which has made working here more enjoyable. (or at least they are not complaining as much?) challenging. innovative. iterates to perfection. customer-centric. other employees in the same team are nice and helpful.canteenhealthcare there is great platform set for those who love to learn, literally it's learning environment friendly people, customer centric company, a lot of things to learned from very talented people, carrers opportunities work culture, no dress code, lesser hierarchy compared to other companies, lesser work stress. good work environment and infrastructure. -

it's worth 5 of anywhere else. i've had no trouble getting my foot in the door elsewhere simply because i worked for amazon. right now also the pay is pretty good because of the stock options, though that didn't use to be the case and certainly there is a belief that amazon does not share the wealth the way it should. free flexpass, smart people, casual environment, can learn a lot to build things to scale small company entrepreneurial feel with a big, reputable company brand name great, smart people who are passionate about their roles as builders. high bar for excellence and analytics. challenging and constantly changing business opportunities that make each job \"new again\" on a regular basis. jeff is a visionary and is one of the few ceos of fortune 500 companies that is actively involved in creating value for shareholders. amazon attracts very bright engineers who are motivated to solve large and complex problems. the culture encourages creative and diverse solutions and promotes knowledge sharing through brown bags and tech talks. amazon has created a robust technical community within the company. high ownership, and ability to make significant differnce. each individual has lot of power and freedom to make the s/w better. employees are generally not restricted by process. amazon.com is an amazing place to learn. the decentralized, self-starter atmosphere strongly supports and encourages people who are motivated to try new things. in just months of being here, you'll end up having responsibilities that most companies wouldn't hand off from the legions of middle management for years. you're able to touch every aspect of the business, from the actual business side (tco, business justifications, cost/benefit analysis, etc), to the deeply technical side (even all the way to choosing whatever technology, language, and platform you like). every role has a huge amount of autonomy and responsibility.additionally, there are no middle-management drones here. every person i've met here is top-notch; blisteringly intelligent and an extremely valuable asset to the company. like most companies, there are some folks who might do better in other roles... but i've been overwhelmed by just how good these people are. coming from a different company where a lot of people just \"coast\", this is a nice, refreshing change. work hard, have fun and make history none unless you like being a robot you will find the motivation to get a better job. easy work, nice people to work with, lots of paid and unpaid time off, great benefits, lots of different shifts that can help anyone + density of talent: really smart people, tough interviewing+ brand: goes without saying though other companies are increasingly not hiring amazonians at senior level because of concerns of disrupting their culture as amazonians are getting increasingly arrogant you get to work with really smart people and constantly push the limits. amazon sets the standard for e-commerce which ids really exciting. the company really does try to live by their leadership principles - they don't just pay lip service to them. excellent pay. excellent pay. great coworkers. people are there to help out not a damn thing really i have never seen a company grow as fast as amazon. if your goal is to move up with a corporation, amazon will give you unparalleled opportunity. it's not unheard of for someone to go from entry-level management to mid or even senior level within 5 years.stock grants are extremely good. entry level management are awarded tens of thousands of dollars in stock from the beginning, and given how fast amazon stock is growing, this can net you a substantial amount of money if you stay long enough for it to vest. salary is competitive for the market, and the sign-on bonus is very compelling and lasts two years (first year is often given upfront while the second year is monthly over 12 months).if you work in seattle, the campus is huge and beautiful. it's in a fantastic area on the southern edge of lake union. there are several buildings with amazing views from the rooftop gardens, and dogs are welcome (even revered). food trucks are plentiful in the area and serve amazing lunch opportunities. amazon will pay for your bus/public transportation costs to get to the campus.finally, you will be working with some of the smartest, most dedicated, most talented people you've ever met. everyone who works there is driven, intelligent, innovative, and competitive, and you will undoubtedly become a better person simply for being in the same area as them. pros are few but i think management has \"likable\" people. they will tell you that their metrics are \"scientific\" and by the letter. very strong on metrics and \"meeting\" optimum output. the set-up for healthcare benefits is great, however. enjoy the work and pace it requires amazon is an innovative and forward thinking company. overtime and benefits are a plus. at amazon, much will be required from you. you will be expected to stand long hours (9+), you will be expected to meet your departments performance goals, and you will be expected to arrive and be at your station on time. should you be able to continuously perform these duties you will be rewarded. the rewards come in the form of bonuses, higher compensation, and possibilities for advancement. in the fulfillment center where i work (baltimore, md), there are close to 80 managers and assistant managers. this means that leadership opportunities are open to those who can truly display what it means to be an amazonian. by excelling at the basics you can prove to your managers that your are ready for leadership roles, which includes more responsibility. those who want to just \"work a job\" will not advance and will more than likely quit. it's not for everyone, but if you can make it the rewards are vast in number. i've been at amazon for several years in different technical roles and teams as engineer, project manager, engineering manager etc.. overall, my experience has been very positive and i would recommend amazon as a good place to work to my friends.* generally low bureaucracy due to decentralization of decision making - decisions get made quickly and you can focus on doing your job* work with really smart and capable people - the hiring process is tough and most people that get hired are exceptional* long term thinking around most business initiatives gives us room to make mistakes, learn from them and get better. other places i have worked at prior to amazon are myopic about the bottom line that lead to many poor decisions.* strong culture around try hard things and successfully executing on them - this experience will make you better at whatever you do after this.* the company is still growing incredibly fast (the employee count doubles every twenty months even though its been 20 years since the company was founded). this translates to lots of new and exciting projects and ideas being worked on across the company we get to work with the most latest technologies in the market, cutting edge technological trends and the impact of the work is immediately seen in the results. it seems that the work is daunting and challenging and brings out the best in you. learn alot of different technologies amazing people, lots of talented and smart personsbusiness growing very fastfosters individual initiatives continuous growth and innovation -well-designed intern project-provided great experience to interns including team lunch, happy-hour and filed trip-a great team: very diverse and balanced pay was ok, time-off policy was great, excellent benefits, great managers. probably the easiest place of employment to get time off if needed, as long as it was outside of the most busiest parts of the year. you meet a lot of different people some are interesting and some are just flat out weird. it makes the job go by if you talk to them great place to work at, to solve technical problems lots of responsibility, great co-workers, stable company, good benefits in addition to having many different types of casual meet ups. good training, challenging work, able to make decisions and act upon them. good benefit package. overall my 9 year experience with amazon is positive, working in both operations and human resources. innovative and always come up with new ideas getting straight out of college and getting 4 years industry experience in one year. the amount of experience you get from this place is phenomenal, because it is so fast-paced. the trainings are great. they send you to different cities for multiple trainings and its nice to meet new people and see interesting places.the compensation is crazy. i was a university hire so when i saw the amount of money amazon was willing to give me, all of the other offers went out of the window. along with the large signing bonuses, it makes it hard to even compare them with any other offers you get as a senior in college. i was making way more money than any of my peers were making and the signing bonus, i was almost embarrassed to tell my friends in fear they would be envious.after you work for amazon for any amount of time, your appeal to recruiters go sky high. recruiters know that amazon offers incredible training for its workers and that the managers that work there will not be there for very long. i worked at amazon for only 4 months before recruiters from other companies were contacting me about other job opportunities. great company to work for, great benefits, diverse employees, potential to grow with company fast. laid back. nice pay. fun. great management. on the right team and project, amazon is a great place to work. extremely talented people, and interesting problems. amazon leans heavily towards investing in the long term which means it explores some fascinating areas and makes big bets. think of it as a well funded vc firm funding many startups (aws, amazon instant video, amazon fresh, etc.) i have never been in a place where so many intelligent, easy to work with employees worked. there is no red tape or bureaucracy. everything works like a well oiled machine. if you ever have an opportunity to work here, jump on it! get to run a business everyday, meet great employees and get to connect with them, amazing benefits, can get promoted quickly if you perform well lots of ownership -

setting. lots of opportunity for growth as the company continues to dominate all things retail. opportunities in the us and globally are always available and amazon allows you to move into other roles

(although i'm sure my managers did). amazon attracts some of the best talent in the world. i am constantly learning from my peers and i'm challenged on a daily basis. it's great working for a company that is defining e-commerce around the world. most companies say that they care about their customers, but no one lives and breathes it like amazon. customers mean everything. it is far more important for amazon to make their customers happy than their employees.amazon has a good compensation program if you're willing to stick it out for 4 years (easier said than done). i'm an experienced hire with an mba from a top 5 program - my base salary was on par with many corporate jobs (maybe slightly lower). i was given a nice cash signing bonus (a little over half my yearly salary) split up over 2 years. i was also given stock (originally worth about 2/3 my salary) that vests over 4 years (80% of it coming in years 3 and 4). fast-paced, great training, chances for growth you will learn from the best and will be constantly challenged to go above and beyond. experience at amazon is easily marketable to other retail or ecommerce related companies. most likely in any new workplace you will keep thinking about customers first and customer obsession as the way to win. nothing much to say at all. the company has good benefits and the freedom to leave early with your banked time. pick your own schedule, virtual your off early 1:30pm usually it has a good equal amount of opportunities friendly co-workers, great supervisors who listen to any concerns. amazon is an amazing company, they are an

interesting technologies* a strong commitment to building tools and infrastructure to makelife easier for devsas a manager, if you're in these shiny areas, you own your project,soup-to-nuts. you will work *with* program managers and productmanagers, not for them. it isn't an easy environment to manage in:you're generally expected to do a lot of things that other companiesuse tpms for, but i personally find the challenge very rewarding. no monoculture or bureaucracy - within your team you have a lot of control over what tools you use. the quality of sdes is pretty high. no \"architects\" or \"research teams\" sucking up all the resources. chance to work with the latest technologies.chance to try out new/innovative ideas.work around lots of smart people.very aggressive place if you

pleasure. furthermore, the compensation is good, the benefits are good, you can work from home at reasonable intervals, and hours are flexible (in that you can basically work whenever you want, within reason.) - interesting work- deal with scales you can't get in many other places- can feel like you're contributing to customer experience and the bottom line get exposure to most of the best

managers is a must if you wish to build yourself up in your position. keep your rate up along with your consistancy and you have no need to worry. amazon has amazing benifits and amazing managers. every morning and post lunch there is a stand up and the managers do a great job to pep you up and keep you motivated, along with stretches which definitely help you through the day. did i mention the 3 day weekends?! you will learn what corporate greed feels like and hopefully learn to avoid it at all costs in the future.they offer profit share but it is dependant on meeting productivity goals for

work with the latest technologies. forward thinking mentality. customer centric. smart colleagues. good learning experience for how to be frugal, work harder than you ever have and get no feedback or praise in return. good place to work fun the people here are the best and brightest that i have worked with. the level of responsibility and input into the company's direction is amazing. fun work environment, casual attire, quality not quantity, intelligent coworkers... data driven company with leadership development focus. values mba great benefits and easy hiring process this is absolutely the best team i have ever been part of in my career. i love working with these people. and the projects are interesting too. :)but it really depends on the team at amazon, i hear horror stories from other people, and it is kind of hard to believe i work at the same company sometimes. :)that being said i do feel very appreciated working here. the regular events are pretty amazing. bring your parent to work day was probably my favorite so far. :)- good pay- decent benefits- nice work environment- flexible work hours and wfh arrangement- work life balance- my colleagues- great managers- adjustable standing desks- nice portable laptops (even if i'm not a mac fan. :d)- good tools and build system that are constantly being improved- leadership principles- customer obession- clear career and promotion process- mentoring program- learning talks there is so much to learn while working at amazon. every day, i was presented with different challenges that makes me think out-of-the box to solve it differently. the community support is excellent for several types of challenges and mentorship is the officially supported method to yield long-term benefits. i grew from sde to sdm at amazon and i have worked in two different countries myself and collaborated with teams around the globe. the vast variety of data poses several key challenges and keeps you on your toes always. the teams have great potential, people, work culture and enormous problems to solve. innovation and think big is one of the greatest thing you can see everywhere around you benefitslaid back atmosphereincentives -very flexible you pick up shifts on your phone-easiest work you will ever do-no interview for job pay, large break room and food trucks. good benefitsif you are desperate for some liveable money, work here at the outset, i want to put a disclaimer that in case you find this outrageously positive in the tone of the feedback, it is actually and i might sound like i am obsessed with amazon, because, well i might be. i will also take the opportunity to say that this feedback is purely my personal opinion and does not represent the company in any way. i am doing this voluntarily because i want to.i can only tell what i learnt newly and in spite of being in the industry for many years, i felt i have learnt so many things and maybe, for the first time, actually got to see how institutionalized certain things are, though they seem to be not really alien in concepts in other companies as well. to start with, metrics as a way to define, both the problem and the solution. the concept is certainly not new to most companies, but not in the form i have observed and learnt at amazon. it actually becomes part of your dna where you habitually do it and not as a top down mandate.this takes us to the next logical step where we define goals for yourself and the team. i have not seen where this is not the case. but again, its in the way it is done at amazon. the way metrics are used to define these probably make a world of difference.next comes the leadership principles that amazon has so effectively come to represent. come to think of it, why would we want to hire anyone who doesn’t already have these imbibed in himself or herself. the focus on strong technical knowledge along with testing a person in terms of their leadership skills during an interview itself makes people proud of themselves. this pride multiplies as we become interviewers ourselves. again, typical of amazon, you don’t qualify to become an interviewer yourself because you are now in amazon. you go through a process called making great hiring decisions and for every interview, you have some one called a bar raiser who will ensure we are setting a relentlessly high standard in hiring. again, no company will want to make poor hiring decisions, but not many have such a well defined mechanism to ensure so. and again, this ties back to what jeff bezos always maintained, ‘good intentions don’t always work. good mechanisms do’.the last thing is the quality of people you work with. you work with a lot of intelligent people around you and, the best thing about amazon is the number of highly tenured employees you get to meet. nobody is above details and expectedly so. it helps you be on your toes all the time. when people always talk in terms of the leadership principles, it seemed pretty odd to me initially, but, not unsurprisingly, became a habit with me too as these principles really form the foundation of amazon.i haven’t talked a lot about the amazon leadership principles in particular because this is about my experience and not really something that can easily be googled for. 1. 👍🏻, proactive corporate approach/interplay with employees.2. benefits, day one. (way cool. 😜)3. mandatory ot during 'peak period' (11/01-->12/26). extra $$$ is never a bad thing. even if i have to earn it.4. amazon has a very modern, cutting-edge, eclectic approach to mgmt style, to its hr approach/interplay. but productivity is productivity is productivity. best environment to learn new things and work with job was great for people who have other jobs or are going to school. the work was relatively easy but exciting. have experience in fulfillment centers both in packing and shipping. familar with shipping software having used federal express and ups software to expedite

opportunity alot of paid time off and unpaid time off opportunities i worked at the fulfillment center for the summer, and it was a great experience. working in the outbound department, i had very friendly and understanding team members, leaders, and management. since they're set up as four days off, three days off, i never felt overwehlmed when working there. after 90 days, they offered to hire me as a regular associate rather than just a seasonal employee, and subsequently that's when you're eligible to recieve an amazing benefit package. i personally loved the company culture there, in a way i looked forward to stand-up at the beginning of shifts and after lunch becasue everyone was always so upbeat and friendly. they definitely expect a lot out of you, but my team was very understanding and looked to correct my mistakes, rather than condone them. the only reason i left was because school started again, while they were open and willing to work around my class schedule, i ultimately turned it down because my courseload was too much for me to handle. while i can't speak for other locations, i personally had a great experience and highly recommend working for amazon.

willing to put in the work, you can almost always get it implemented.the company has a strong culture. many organizations have a set of \"values\" but they aren't always used or implemented. in

this is not a cliché, it is my actual experience. i am also enjoying being dared, challenged. amazon competes against itself and so do i. there's no joy competing against others since once you beat them you end up being demotivated. here i can work to give the best of me and learn how to increase my capabilities.i joined amazon as a sr. vendor manager after being a marketing director at lg electronics for 4 years and a brand manager at p&g for 8 years. amazon has fulfilled my expectations which was moving into a company with people smarter than me and where i constantly learn new things without being bored about more of the same. nice work spaceno work pressure fundamentally sound company. strong growth yoy still, and should become a force in the retail industry for years to come as internet continues to become a bigger part of our life. there is no explicit path to promotion. one day you are all of a sudden approached as a candidate for management. . amazon is cutting edge, innovative, well recognized, and a market leader. they have shown the world they not only can survive amongst a very competitive landscape, but thrive in a down market. that is due to world class operations, relentless focus on margin improvement, and a very frugal internal attitude. as others have mentioned, due to the speed and lean environment, it's somewhat in a disarray internally which leaves mountains of opportunity for self-starters to make immediate impacts to the bottom lines. opportunities to move within the company are good and encouraged which expose you to the full scope of the business thus deepening your understanding of how all the pieces fit together, what works, and what does not. great career opportunity and a fun job if you are doing what you like in this company which is i guess 90+% of the employees. they make sure that they hire the right people with desire to work and have fun on the job. the interview process is kind of thorough i my point of view is that it is also effective. they don't want people coming from the street just for the money. they seek for people with passion and expertise in the area that they are applying for. employees are getting rewarded accordingly with stocks and other benefits. you'll work with some of the smartest people you've met it will provide you with the broadest understanding of how a business should work and will prepare you for your next experience it is a big company with amazing brand recognition. the company is doing very well; not said about many companies in these hard economic times. if you truly enjoy working very hard and put most of your energy into your work this is a great place to work. there are no nine to five jobs at amazon. it is a great place to work if you are truly committed to self-development-don't expect the company to teach you how to do your job. you will be surrounded by people who are bright and future focused...there isn't time to get caught up in the past. if you are interested in massively scalable systems, amazon is great to understand what true scaling means.if you are early in your career, amazon can expose you to a wide range of technologies, and give you a a lot of responsibility quickly. there will also be a lot of people like you to hang out with, develop friendships with and so on. amazon does a lot of college hiring, so there are a lot of like minded bright people in the software engineering areas.there is an employee discount, which is nice to have.seattle is a great area.amazon has a lot of tools support for software engineers, and puts a lot of effort into making it easy to build, deploy and update software. most everyone has an opportunity to add value at amazon. it's definitely a culture where great ideas are appreciated and,. sometimes, acted on. you are surrounded by smart, ambitious people. the best part is the flexible hours. the job is project based, so as long as you get your stuff done, you can come in early, late, whatever. while the job is technically an office job, you can work from home on days that you have a doctor's appointment, or if you are feeling under the weather. you get a laptop, which is nice. the bus/transit pass was a real nice perk. you can opt for subsidized parking if you prefer. you get stock grants, and good health benefits. time off options, leadership principles are encouraging, feedback (when actually given) is transparent, and great people that can deal with great flexibility and can adapt quickly the business in its self is doing very well as far as having a customer obsession based approach in making sure orders are being fulfilled for customers on time. good pay that was the only good thing i can say fast paced, smart co-workers, opportunities for ownership and leadership. expect to work on the latest technologies. data driven. there is nothing really good about working here. you are treated horribly and micro manage constantly here. the manager are hipocrates the people there are amazing and fun to work with and it keeps my body in shape. four ten hour days with 10 hours of overtime per week almost always available. great benefits and you manage your own time off and have plenty of paid and unpaid time off. really good job to work for fast pace. high volume. great atmosphere. great people and great culture working at amazon was pretty good for the most part, it was sometimes fun, benefits were great - super flexible schedule outside of holidays- weekly pay the pay was good after overtime great payamazing benefitsstock plan401kvery generous time off options(40h/year paid, 80h vacation/ year paid, 80h/year unpaid)+ medical/personal/military/maternity leave optionsschool accommodations (proof of enrollment required)career choice rogramgreat opportunity for advancement.guaranteed hours. excellent benefitsgreat peoplegood pay open door policy, great break rooms and fast paced. if you want a lot of hours during peak season you can get plenty. pay is good in industry great environment to around. easy job to me not really hard. offers dental and vision benefits. pay is 13.50 if you're permanent. work life,no shifts,food coupon,good management good value for peak performers. the company keeps growing and there are loads of opportunities to move around. flexible working hours in most cases. work experience in amazon is far different from the other,they believe in work hard as well as having fun at the same time, tremendous growth opportunities. good open communication, various verticals of organisations, work timings no pressure in office premises,lots of fun freedom of expression, benefits, company name 1. big problems - at amazon, no problem is pushed aside as too hard to solve. in fact, they go after the really hard and insolvable problems and then throw talent, time and resources towards solving them. in my time there, pretty much every team i worked with was solving a \"holy grail\" problem in their field and actually making progress towards it. there is no dearth of interesting projects, teams or ideas to work on.2. structure and thinking - there is a lot of document writing at amazon, in case you have not heard. while some people do not like that part of the job much, i think the required meetings and documents force every employee to truly think about their job and what they are doing. producing the write-ups and getting them ready to face up to a room of very detailed scrutiny and questioning forces you to think through every aspect of your business. it is really a very valuable skill that amazon does a great job of developing.3. ownership - amazon treats you like an owner - a grown up. you have a job to do and you are empowered to do it. there are checks and balances, of course, but you truly do own your business. you make the assessments, take the risks, justify your decisions and ultimately reap the benefits or learn from your mistakes and move on. there are not many fall-backs and layers to catch you if you are not moving your business forward. not a lot of finger poitning for failures either, that i saw. in fact, i would say that if you do not act like an owner, you will not be successful at amazon. you have to embrace the responsibility and run with it.4. smart people - you'll hear this a lot and personally, i think some of the talk is overblown but amazon does indeed have some very, very smart and talented people working there. i know its a cliche, but i did learn a lot from most people i worked with there - and again, i say, most, not all :-) are just genuinely nice people. i would work again with these people without hesitation. i think the leadership there is especially great - just really smart, experienced people with sharp instincts, great insights and lots of ambition. it was really fun working with the folks i did. very user friendly tool to refer candidates awesome environment, perks and excellent colobarotation ebtween teams great place to strive and thrive as amazon is the best employer in terms of flexibility as amazon will provide a great platform especially for those who are seeking creative freedom to explore,innovate and do things in a best logical way by challenging the status quo.professionally,its a career enriching experience for me as i have transformed a lot after becoming an amazonian and i can sense the difference within myself as am evolving each and every day in my career. good fun safe to work with!!! goo working culture!!! benefits start on day one. there are none other than 4 day work week. the healthcare after 90 days is especially generous but was told during hiring that it was just one benefit that would begin immediately, which it doesn't. challenging work.lot of responsibility - will love your work. fantastic work environment great team.love to work there provided a very flexible environment to work. benefits, consistent hours for actual amazon employees, smx

higher than competitive positions. the benefits are fantastic. there are many times i go to the doctor or dentist and the office manager is surprised at how much is covered. they offer restricted stock units and with their stock doing so well, it really adds up. the company is growing every year so your opportunities are endless...as long as you are willing to relocate. i love how fast-paced it is. i love that management is very attuned to the needs of the business and adjusts our time up or down accordingly. i think that just makes great business sense and it's impressive that they can accomplish something that must be insanely complex.the facility i work in is so clean. it's beautiful, well lit. everything. there isn't anything negative about the job. you get a couple of people who don't pull they're weight, but that is every company. great training and culture. interesting and dynamic environment with a lot of driven smart people. plenty of opportunity for learning and expanding one's skills and definitely not a boring place to work. there are opportunities for international travel and changing teams every couple of years is encouraged. many hours/overtime 60 hours a week amazon is a very reputable company that most people recognize. beside that, the pay is okay ($13/hr). you get some employee perks such as 10% off in amazon online shopping. if you participate in unpopular shifts (in which they are desperate), you can get prizes. the people there are diverse. the interview process is very easy...because there is no interview. i work from home. im in the comfort of my home and dont have to commute. there are lots of opportunities to move up if you work hard. work from home, that's about it, no other pros blah blah blah big company, more technology to handle good pay and benefits, work from home, holiday policy, paternity and maternity leaves 1. early promotions2. good facilities3. food coupons4. transport reimbursement5. flexible shift6. friendly

pierced eyelids. you can still get a decent job at amazon fulfillment. great company, people, and stock! amazon is one of those rare companies where you can work and produce products that everybody uses, knows about and respects. as an individual, you're empowered and encouraged to work backwards from the customer to make the best possible experience for the end customer (which we often are too).i've enjoyed doing this with the amazon prime video group and now with alexa.i'm currently hiring, if you're interesting in doing cool stuff in alexa, pm me :) room for growth, agile ideas. it's

their best. i didn't experience any of the cutthroat backstabbing you hear in some extreme reviews. however, i know many people who have felt betrayed by others. amazon is a good place to make connections, but i don't find it to be the type of company you want to settle down with for more than 2-3 years. work life balance is in your hands. if you dont take control of it, amazon will milk all your time. $2,000 in amazon visa gift cards in your account every day starting pay for overnight weekend shifts is 14.00 per hour, 401k, health benefits starting day 1, opportunities for

demonstrated a lot of \"hustle\". you can coast by doing the bare minimum, but hard work will get you on a first-name basis with the managers, which puts you at the front of the line for the less dull positions at the site, and it also gives you a line of defense if your performance is put into question.the job makes for a good workout, particularly if you can get in on some of the more scarce

as well. \"can't please them all\" - also, what world do people live in where cliques and people with similar goals and interests don't congregate together? if the goal is to better themselves,

workplace if you really do understand it.5.) you are not allowed to work extra at your own discretion so this will curb exploitation of you fellow associates. the performance matrix is calculated only for the hours you worked, i.e., if you were off work due to other official reasons or extra curricular activities, your matrix/efficiency will be based only upon the time you did your job. good

to see all of the innovating things amazon is working onamazon is a very data driven company, finance always has a seat at the table and you can make a great impact as a business analyst as well. you will always learn something new @ amazon irrespective of how many years you work in amazon. that's why we call everyday as day1 extremely fast decision making and very non-hierarchical in the decision

benefits 1.) the job is not that boring.2.) decent pay.3.) optional extra hours i loved the sense of community that each team felt like. being on a close knit team while pioneering new spaces was one of the best work experiences i've ever had. to have survived the infamous cloud drive/cloud music release (amazon underestimated the amount of people the new features would bring in and the team was woefully underprepared to handle the call/email volume and had vague blurbs at first). brings a tear to my eyes just thinking about what my team went through during the weeks following that incident)also how much other teams were willing to help out teams that were under heavy unexpected call volume. amazon instant video broke (like it had a tendency of doing) but during this time, everything went down. as in can't connect to amazon servers across all devices. my team, along with everyone else, pulled all but 2-3 agents to help aiv out (at peak, there was 800+ calls in queue).management (at least to me) was amazing and super helpful. affordable healthcare and friendly co-workers health and dental insurance and only work 4 days a week 10 hour shifts. great stock options, great health care through kaiser (but only if you live in ca) but not free like other tech companies in the bay area, fast paced challenging environment that will always keep you busy great benefits and peoples great place for new grad - good place to develop software engineering technical skills amazon is a wonderful place to work . management. no micromanaging.15 minute breaks every 2

so looks good on a cv. best environment to work in, every one is eay to approach career development, opportunities for progression, work with great people, high hiring bar, opportunities to contribute to both local and global environments full time associates has good benefits best work culture, no extreme level of hierarchy in management no dress code and free work culture amazon gives us a clear picture of the openings in our regions and also others. they give us direct access to the hiring manager and recruiter which i like the most. started off with promises of promotion yet nobody is the slightest bit interested in what skills you have as long as you keep doing the job they train you to do when you start. so forget any chance of promotion in amazon its all a big con. a lot to learnmanagerial position since day 1very good salarywork in a huge company with an excellent reputation data learninglearn to work with less resourcesglobal opportunities the organizational values are amazing. i believe in jeff bezos's approach to the 6 pager project proposal in that if you can't articulate your idea and how to deliver it using full and grammatically correct sentences (no power point allowed) then you don't know what you're doing. i learned a lot about communication and thinking through and idea entirely before wasting someone's time with half-baked descriptions of ideas. very smart people. fast pace operations paid time and unpaid time is nice fun to work at, open environment experience and great opportunity to meet new people especially if that is an area you want to work in at amazon they trust you to finish a project from start to finish which is awesome. technically the work is challenging good salaryopportunity for advancementlow stress top notch engineers and better management than most large companies. they have an emphases on accomplishing features for the customers rather than playing in a sandbox just for entertainment of cool ideas. there's always something new to work on: whether it's an upcoming release of a new product or feature, or a new method of attempting to provide a better customer experience. you work with some of the smartest people around, and it shows. teams are small and maintain ownership of their areas with little to no interference from other teams.the company's leadership principles are everything here. customer obsession wins every time, which is the way it should be. great learning opportunity on the syst skills like access and excel -i consistently deal with technical candidates that are absolutely outstanding at what they do (code, lead teams/projects, team players, strong customer focus, etc). this is perhaps one the most attractive aspect of working for aws/amazon.-plenty of recruiting tools to choose from. a 300% increase from other companies which i have consulted for on a contract basis (10 years plus).-management will take new recruiting tool suggestions seriously assuming it is presented with facts.-hiring managers will spend money on \"out of the box\" job posting ads or larger features depending on reasoning and need.-recruiting management doesn't micro manage by any means if you have decent hiring numbers.-fast paced environment but for the right reasons since aws is growing so fast. very similar to a staffing agency environment in many ways but i enjoyed working for an agency years back. move quickly, share candidates if appropriate and build quality pipelines for your hiring managers and everything will be fine.-more pros than cons in my opinion. enjoy working with very intelligent peers. amazon.com is a challenging, fun, and ultimately rewarding experience. you have a lot of potential for career growth, with sdes able to get promoted to the vp level while remaining an individual contributor. if you can find a good team, with a supportive manager, you can definitely excel.you are given a lot of responsibility -- even sde-1s own a part of the software stack and are responsible for delivering on it.with ownership comes responsibility. you are expected to be oncall and maintain your software end to end. most teams have an oncall rotation, no dedicated qa staff, and full autonomous ownership of a subset of amazon.com. i consider this a pro -- i love working in a place that trusts its engineers to make decisions, and gives us full responsibility from end-to-end. as a senior engineer at amazon, you will come up with the business idea for what to do, help management prioritize it appropriately, design the architecture end-to-end, implement the code, test the code, deploy the code, and finally maintain the code if anything goes wrong. it's exhilarating, challenging, and a lot of fun. but it's not for everyone.amazon.com's service oriented architecture ensures that most teams at amazon own a subset of amazon services, which means that they are responsible for defining the roadmaps for their service. as a senior engineer, you often spend part of your time as a product manager, helping define the roadmap for your services. it's a great opportunity to grow.finally, the promotion process is fair and puts the power in the hands of the engineer up for promotion. you are given a clear document on what it takes to get to the next level (sde1->sde2, sde2->sde3, sde3->principal being the main ones.) then you are given full power to seek out projects that get you to the next level. amazon won't care about your years of experience -- it will promote you solely based on your merit, which is great if you can prove yourself. minimum office dramasde has a very big power over their daily projectworking on new technology customer focus, good projects, move fast always keep busy, whether its monthly work or ad-hoc 'fires' to put out; there's always something going on. you have the ability to do what you want and go with it rather than seeking the approval of others. being from amazon is great for you career. it looks good on a resume and you can learn a lot. the company is innovative and the aws offering is very strong. it can transform a business. there are a lot of smart people here and they will make you better. a couple years here will make you better but there is a price. adverture exprencing fun busy crazy 1. people actually buy into the famed leadership principles, so there is a common place to start from when

some of the smartest people in the technology and retail world work at amazon. that being said, every day becomes a learning opportunity. for someone early in their career (less than 5-6 years of work experience), it's truly a great place to work. amazon is unique in that it's a pretty small company that manages to accomplish a lot. that means leaner teams and everyone becomes experts in multiple areas. as a \"stepping stone\" job, it's a good place to learn new skills (especially in the project management arena) that can lead to bigger and better things.i became a new dog owner when i was working there, so to be able to bring my dog into the office was a huge plus. granted there are rules and restrictions (especially in certain buildings on the new campus), but i still thought that was

worked for. amazon is changing the world and is continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible. only the best are hired to work for amazon, and the high caliber performance of colleagues is noticeable. work life balance is nothing like the horror stories of the nyt article, however it varies team to team.the south lake union campus is fantastic and makes for a great place to work. dog friendly buildings and co-workers is a great stress reliever. amazon's leaders are dedicated to generating long-term customer value, not just in their words but by their actions. there is a serious commitment to identifying and investing in future leaders who will continue to grow and improve amazon's leadership culture. ideas are evaluated and decisions made with an almost scientific rigor, with a strong preference for data-driven discussions. in the absence of data, calculated risk taking is acceptable as long as plans include gathering data, failing fast, and avoiding \"one-way doors\". the culture is apolitical, and one can find much support among universally intelligent peers, if one makes earnest effort along a compelling plan that incorporates feedback. you will learn a lot here, and you can lead amazing, high-impact contributions that are literally changing the world. i joined aws with a great fear that i will be working crazy hours and have non stop stress and my experience have been the exact opposite of that.my manager is supportive, thinks about my career and long term goals.my team has massive impact and we're building incredible stuff with the latest technologies.aws is like working for a startup with lots of funding.managed bottom's up style. a very good life changing experience to work on problems at global scale. lots of autonomy. ton of stuff to learn. just making a little (emphasis) money on the side. they are willing to work with school schedules in order to have you finish school and not put you in danger i own the customer experience for a category and i can honestly say that this is the most fun i've had professionally in my 20 years of working. the work is challenging, but i wouldn't have it any other way...i also make a habit of telling people on my team that the path to success at amazon isn't by working crazy hours, it is getting a lot done in the hours that you do work. i've also grown more professionally in the past 4 years than i did in the previous 16. great environment, innovative, exciting, diverse laid back startup feel at a big company amazon web services presents an environment of constant learning. there is never a dull day as there is so much happening in the public cloud space and aws is leading the way. keeping pace with the innovation is a challenge but extremely rewarding. i've never been surrounded by a group of co-workers that were so invested in each other's success. very refreshing! full of challenge and growth opportunities. office location in seattle downtown is pretty nice, walkable to westlake and pike market, lots of things you can do in there, the transportation is also very convenient. money is good, benefits are amazing. literally the only reason i stayed as long as i did. the emloyees make a great community. - nice coworkers- okay starting job and something part time insurance 401k work overtime acknowledged off 3 days a week. team autonomy , work-life balance, salary, benefits fast paced and the comparadarie was excellent! the benefits are excellent. many opportunities for higher positions if you put in the effort. its a perfect way to learn logistics. you don't have to be at work if you have the time to cover it. with that being said if you don't come to work, you don't have answer any questions or really call out. your time, your responsibility. saying you work for amazon really does get you far outside of work.... benefits pay dress code schedule city nice people to work with not enough shifts were available. good pay and benefits the managers made you feel like a family is sdf 4. amazon is a wonderful company to work for. great organization structure in management. they are doing their best to be innovative and forward thinking. meet a lot of

can learn a lot in the fast growing company great benefits and beautiful seattle views. the people who work at amazon are among the best and very capable. some of my best confidants have come from my coworkers. at amazon i feel happy and like i'm making a difference. amazon is a fast growing company with its tendrils in numerous areas of commerce and technology. its great to work on something that has a major global impact. they are doing good business for sure. as a shareholder i would love to own it. their philosophy is customer centered, everything is to create the best customer experience, even at the expense of low profit margin, which i totally agree. the loyal customer base is essential. if you are interested in moving ahead, particularly as an engineer, it is all in your hands. if you are smart, work hard, put in extra time, you're almost guaranteed to move ahead quickly. politics don't come into play nearly as much as results. the work is pretty chanllenging, lots of new things to learn. and the money is pretty good. really smart, motivated employees. you ship software often and can see the results of your work frequently. one year at amzn is equivalent to several years of experience at most other companies. if you look around you can find really cool projects, many of which are greenfield and do not require supporting old code. having amazon on your resume will also open a bunch of doors for you. i received a never-ending stream of emails and phone calls from recruiters while i worked there. generally speaking, you have a great deal of latitude in working on things that interest you. amazon is packed full of opportunities. there's plenty of space to grow both personally and technically and challenges abound. the real beauty of the place is that individual groups and teams are given nearly full reign in how they operate as long as they produce the desired results. this level of freedom means that those teams which require strict sdlc methodologies to meet high availability requirements can apply those, while teams who do not require as strict of a methodology are also free to explore agile approaches. there are lots of available tools for working in certain ways, but teams are not required to use those tools and are welcome to use others of their own choosing. this freedom keeps the work environment fresh and interesting, even as amazon has grown into a truly large company.the other aspect of amazon that is truly rewarding is the \"ownership\" attitude that is fostered. not code ownership, per se, but rather company ownership. any employee is encouraged to think about how the project they are doing improves customer experience, drives down costs, and overall improves the business. anyone can say \"i don't think that this is a good customer experience,\" and people tend to listen. there aren't too many rules or established ways of doing things so if you're the type who wants to try out new things, write new code or that kind of thing you'd love it. you wont hear no as long as it doesn't cost the company money. if it doesnt cost any money then you can do virtually anything you want. probably half the cool stuff on our site comes from ideas people had and tried out on their own. it is definitely a good place for people without much else going on in their lives because your not going to have time for any thing else. it is a big start up company. original ideas are respected and you see the sprite and growth of a start up company. unlike many high tech companies that i have worked - i like the frugal ways of amazon. it is more long lasting that way and enhances the share holder value in the long run and as an employee you do hold a large amount of company stock. there are lot of new initiatives which keeps the innovation level very high. at the same time mere visionaries and arm chair thinkers have no chance of surviving in the company. innovation is only respected if you can execute. the people were great, the brightest i've worked with it's great to work for a company that you're also a customer for. it definitely creates a more fun working environment. since the company is growing, there are a lot of opportunities to dig in and make a difference. if you don't have a lot of experience, it's a good place to start and learn. additionally, the company is making history almost every day, and it's great to be part of the company's achievements. opportunity is everywhere at amazon. joining straight after college, it really molded me into a hard working professional. it helps you identify the type of manager you want to become and gives you insight on how a political corporate american company works. it gives you an experience you will not have working anywhere else. it is an intense work environment and forces you to adapt quickly. success at this company is a mixture of luck, hard work and political talent. pay is good and stock options are more plentiful the longer you work there. if you're lucky enough to be a permanent employee, pay and benefits are better than other opportunities for similar qualifications. 4 day work week is great, and so is overtime pay. stock award is a great pay supplement, but you must work two years for it to vest. the company is always growing and changing. customer service is given leeway to think outside the box. - a place where builders can build- relatively flat company- able to learn and grow so much in a short period of time- opinions are valued at all levels operates like a startupyou will interact with very smart people

really helpful in answering any and all questions. managers are awesome too! they are a little strict about you clocking in and out for lunch and breaks. so make sure you get back to your \"station\"

least. they are growing like a weed and don't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. cloud computing is the future of technology right now so it would seem aws had a pretty clear lead on the competition.i can't speak for every role but the ldr position has its ups and downs. the good parts are that the pay is very competitive with a solid base salary and very nice incentives if you hit your quarterly goals. i also received a very generous signing bonus and will receive a less generous, but still great, year two bonus.aws has a start up vibe to it so things move quickly, which is exciting. you have the ability to implement new best practices and lead change within your sector. this helps get you noterioty which is always a good thing. they are also very big, at least within the sales team, on praising employees for bringing in big deals or whenever a compliment is paid to a specific employee related to their work ethic.work advancement is relatively clear in terms of where you have the ability to go and how long it normally takes you to get there. they are also very flexible with working remote and moving to different parts of the country or even internationally.overall i would say that the pros outweigh the cons by a lot. this large company has excellent benefits. the shift differential for the weekend night shift is worth it. benefits

entrepreneurial company.- amazon years are dog years in terms of learning and experience.- ability to shift roles and career direction through internal mobility.- great principles which guide the internal process of the company.- truly customer oriented (working backwards from the customer). i enjoy working at amazon for multiple reasons:-the people are highly skilled and highly motivated-the leadership principles are embedded in the culture, they are not just a poster on the wall-for my current role, the company was willing to take a chance on someone with minimal relevant experience, which is an indicator that the company is willing to think outside the box-lots of opportunities for career growth, even if your area of interest is not obviously in your current career trajectory-management is engaged in the development of people-fun place to work-amazon has received some negative press about the work environment. from my experience, the work environment has always been positive and constructive-the workforce is very diverse which means people from many different backgrounds and perspectives are represented-flexible schedules: flexible start time/end time and, depending on the team, working from home one day per week-the company wants you to voice your opinion, even if you disagree with your manager and the consensus view. this relates to the leadership principle have backbone; disagree and commit-managers are open to feedback from direct reports which is not the way at all other companies-data is king. your views will gain traction if you have data, or a sound argument if data is not available/possible-caveat to work/life balance rating below: i think most people on my team would give a similar rating but i know of people on other teams who have different experiences at amazon there are many great opportunities to work on exciting projects and teams, and there is a great deal of flexibility as far as team movement is concerned if you find yourself on an unexciting project or an unideal team. amazon is tackling lots of interesting problems. small teams are empowered to develop and implement solutions. i don't feel the 'must do it this

become a very well rounded employee. fast paced environment, room to grow, and a great collection of people that will support you in and outside the office. these are not all pros, but more general knowledge you should know when starting at mkc4 (amazon location in edgerton, ks). this information is for blue-badge members who are full-time.1: starting pay is higher than most general education jobs (almost double the current minimum wage) which starts at $13.00/hr. pay increases ever 6 months2. on your official start day (and if you have never worked a job that requires you to be on your feet 90% of the time), prepare for this. tennis shoes are affordable, but will not fend well on your feet for the first month while you adjust. an investment in timberland work shoes (around $90-120) are worth the expense, and i found them to be durable, and last at least a year.3. understand your benefits: first and foremost, understand that your schedule is like a contract, meaning the hours that you are schedules must be worked, or supplemented with your benefit hours. personal time off (pto), upt (unpaid time), vto (voluntary time off), myleave and vacation are all ways you can make up hours that you may need to miss due to whatever reason.-pto: 48/hrs per year, granted with 10/hrs on the first paycheck of employment or first paycheck of the new year, followed by 3.58/hours for 10 pay periods to follow, with 1.1/hrs on the 12th pay period. these hours can be used at any time. amazon suggest that you save pto hours to use during peak season (oct-dec), as sales are increased, resulting in longer work days and mandatory overtime.-upt: 80/hr per year. upt is granted in 20/hour increments at the start of each quarter (jan 1, april 1, july 1, oct 1). upt is meant for emergency purposes, but can be used as needed. (if an associate used upt, that will negatively affect their vcp, which will be covered later).-vto: is offered by upper management when the labor cost due to lack of orders needs to be reduced. aa's (amazon associates) are able to sign up for vto at the start (or prior day if offered through the hub, which is amazon's online employee portal) in which they will be able to leave mid-shift (or whatever time upper management deems fit) without the need to use upt, pto.-myleave: is a resource that can be used if aas need to be absent from work for long periods of time. they must be approved before hand.-vacation time: 48/hrs a year. full-time employees receive 1.53/hrs of vacation time per pay period. vacation time must be approved by upper management, and cannot be used at any given moment like upt or pto.***note: amazon is firm on the policy of attendance. if you cannot make a shift, it must be covered either by pto, upt, vto, or vacation if approved. if an aa goes negative on their upt, it is an automatic dismissal. be very cautious about our hours. i know it may seem acceptable to use hours that are available to you, but do not risk your employment due to going negative. save save save your hours.4: the days are extremely long. most shifts are 10 hours long per day, with 4 days a week (during regular season, peak season is 60 hours per week). amazon gives it's aas (2) 15 minute paid breaks (actually 10 minutes with 5 minute walking time to and from your location). example of my shift:0730 - 1000 - work1000-1015 - break1015-1230- work1230 - 1300 - lunch1300-1530- work1530-1545- break1545-1800 - work5: departments: a break down of each department:pick - this is a department to be in if you are comfortable driving pit (vehicle in which to retrieve items). mind you pit can mean going 100+ft in the air to retrieve an item, so if you are not good with heights do not do pick.ic/qa: if you are an introvert and do not mind driving pit, this is for you. like pick ic/qa using pit to tally inventory throughout the fc (fulfillment center). it's a slower paced position, best for those who are not super speedy.dock - very physical department. mostly being atetris player by putting boxes into trucks so they will fit and maximize space.inbound: this department receives items into the fc. they drive pit, separate items to be stored, and other task. like ic/qa, this department runs a bit slower.outbound/pack department: this department is to place items to be shipped into boxes. this is the fastest department in the whole fc, and requires a rate of 70 unites boxed per hour. department is good for those who like a fast-paced environment.5: vcp: variable compensation package is a bonus plan amazon gives aas who show up for their shifts and do not use upt, and if the fc is meeting it's goals more than expected:-attendance: if you show up to all your shifts(or covered them with vacation or pto) and do not use upt, you will receive a 4% bonus for the month. example: you work 100 hours in the month, took no upt, and make $13.00/hr, you would receive an addition $52.00.-building too plan: if an fc is functions 105%+ to plan (meeting it's goals by 5% or more than expected), aas will receive an additional 4% bonus. mind you upt is not calculated for building too plan, so if you use upt but the building does 105%+ for the month, you will receive this bonus.***during peak season, vcp moves from a potential 8% to 16%.6: if you like a longer 'weekend', choose either front half or back half shifts when selecting. these shifts run 4 days straight with 3 days off (during regular hours(non-peak). donut shift is for those who like a little break in between, which shift will run mon/tue/thur/fri at work, with wed/sat/sun off during regular hours (non-peak)i wish you the best of luck with amazon. opportunity to learn a lot when launching new sites, doing migrations and building launches. they do have good medical benefits, dynamicsticks to its

besides the managers that in my experience have been difficult to work under, amazon is a great place to work for. most people will complain about the things they signed up for. yes, it does get hot. wear thin, breathable clothing. shorts and tank tops are allowed. get a water bottle and fill it with ice. they have ice machines in the break rooms and water coolers every where.yes, you’re standing for 10-12 hrs. get you a pair of new balance shoes or invest in some really good inserts for your shoes. you get a break every four hours. two 30 min and one 15 min. it takes me two min to walk to break room, not ten like people say.if you haven the worked a labor job before i wouldn’t recommend it. but mostly everything people comeolain about is written out before you even apply. it’s literally in the description of the job. things like mandatory overtime during peak season from november-january. everyone has to comeback in 5 days a week until peak is over. that’s 60hrs a week which sucks, but honestly during christmas, a check every two weeks saying $1,400 isn’t bad. plus you can win gift cards, tvs, playstations and other things just for attendance and or meeting rate.benefits are great. i pay $16 for having both medical and vision for blue cross. i get discounts for pet insurance with nationwide, discounts with sketchers, wineries, cruises, disney, apple and a lot of other places. when you make a year at amazon they offer to pay 95% of your tuition for any high demand career. pto, vto, vet, mto (rarely, but it happens), vacation, upt, medical, dental, vision, 401k, stock options, tuition reimbursement they have awesome benefits. medical vision and dental. 14 weeks 100% paid maternity leave plus 6 weeks for your partner. stocks after 2 years and variable comp bonuses every month based on attendence and building performance. it's a great company to work for this was the worst job i have ever worked. i dont have much positive to say about it. i canceled my amazon prime account after working here because i feel that amazon treats their employees very terribly. this is my third time with amazon. this is also the first time i've experienced such appalling behavior & this level of un-organisation. the \"perks\" are always a plus, but not worth it when i've already had a ptsd breakdown... on my first d!!!! day! the benefits there are great pay is good if you don't have any prior experience working a full time job. very friendly staff and good work environment the pay per hour is great nice coworkers , everyone is very friendly. nice place to work good benefits, work 4 days a week pays well and will hire practically anybody. no resume or education required. great for college students due to the various work shifts available. employees are paid weekly which makes it convenient if you just doing this job for spare cash. seattle is a great city to live in. all 4 levels of managers above me are incredible leaders, and they inspire me everyday. the growth happening at the company right now is amazing. great pay and benefits. pay for all relocation expenses and all training expenses they have decent medical, dental and vision for the price you pay, 4 restricted stock units per year in a fast paced high demand environment. 4 days on 3 days off... thats about it. very good leadership experience. good pay and the ability/expectation to drive change. strong culture on providing specific feedback on performance and opportunities to improve. good benefits and decent pay fast and accurate at what i do one pro to working at amazon is the benefits such as paid time off,paid vacation , voluntary time off etc. literally none except maybe for the health benefits if you last more than a week! good money and people of good character, very friendly good learning, develop leadership, they hire a best, appreciate the hard work getting to work with the best minds.no micromanagement. people only look at your work. *good if you like working on your own and no career development work culture, environment, transport facilities better salary when compared to competitors.mine is a work from home job. so i don't have to stress about travelling and getting ready for office. good perkshigher ctc than marketinternal team switch is easy the salary and the company itself company will care for the employers. best work culture ever. good pay and nice culture good benefits, health insurance, discounts exciting place to work, ever changing day to day, can be rewarding with a high degree of effort. i stay busy without a doubt. coworkers it depends pretty chill. management it's alright fascinating company, opportunity to grow, fun workplace great opportunities and good work culture straightforward training, safety oriented & consistent pace excellent leadership opportunity and growth. always looking for the next great idea. i had a really good leader and some other great people to work with. while it's not suited for a career, you can make some good money during the peak season, which a lot of people with other full time jobs do - great benefits, especially parental leave- stock keeps going up- when you can get into an amazon garage (long waitlist) parking is very reasonable for downtown seattle- ability to move around within the company. you are able to do many different things without having to move to a new company.- i have always been on teams that are very flexible regarding pto, needing to wfh and arrive late/leave early. weekly pay is great to receive. opportunity to lead a team. great place, fast paced, overtime the pay for the period of time you work is worth the wait. great paydiverse benefitslimitless advancementability to relocate love the fast pace and autonomy you have to make an impact. i also really like the people overall. my team has a great culture of helping each other out. access to learning and training is amazing. good money, and driving the vehicles you never pushing yourself too hard but still busy. leading packing lines at amazon looks good on a resume and interview for better jobs the health and stock benefits are nice. the match on the 401k isn't too bad either. every day is a new experience and every experience can be an opportunity to learn. at amazon it is nearly impossible to define the experience you will get. some facilities are slow, easy to maintain and you will not develop much. other facilities are fast paced, full of issues and you will learn a lot. a big phrase at amazon is learn by doing, which holds true. you really will not find any guides, training or much useful information for 99% of the problems you come across.the one part of amazon that i enjoy is most of the time, it is customer oriented. we do give associates great opportunities and positions, but a lot of the time it is for the lucky few who get caught up in it. there is so little organization many people will miss out on great opportunities. good

offer for education such as career choice amazon will teach you a lot. you'll be around brilliant people all day and are bound to learn something new from them, even if you pick it up by osmosis.the things you do are likely to ship. not everything does; as with every company, some projects get canned or put on hold indefinitely, but most things move pretty quickly. even if your particular project never sees the light of day, it's likely that some of the things you did will get repurposed.you'll have a pretty good idea of where you fit into the machine based on your job title and the people around you. this isn't the sort of place where you're going it alone and everyone is siloed off; there are literally thousands of people who can answer questions or collaborate.if you meet or exceed \"the bar\", you will be recognised to a degree. in most cases, effort in equals reward out.being so process-heavy can actually be a blessing in disguise as resources are always available for any problems you might run into and things are fairly well-documented.amazon gets things done and one of the key values is having a backbone -- you're expected to stand your ground if you disagree. this lends itself extremely well to things like eliminating code debt and keeping things moving; there's no groupthink. it can sometimes become a little bit adversarial, but it's not a big issue and is a small price to pay for the advantage it gives the organisation. for a huge company, it's outright nimble.everything is data-driven, which i'll also mention in the cons section. as a pro, though, if you have the data to back it up, you'll be able to get what you want. additionally, your performance is measured with data-driven metrics, so your review shouldn't come as a surprise -- good or bad. the benefits are good. it's an okay place to work. everyone seems pretty friendly. we get little perks here and there. fast paced, high pressure work environment with loose definition leads to lots of

healthy lifestyle will help you stay strong within this company. beat benefits as well once you are a hired on as a full time. amazon is a large company with a lot of great technologies. if you want to work in a specific technological field, odds are amazon has a team that fits you.if you are new to development (recent college graduate), there is a decent learning curve, but lots of tools to help you out. a large community of developers are also available to help you ramp up to be more confident with the immense number of tools amazon leaves at your disposal. after a year or so, you will have

amazon was a great company to work from home for. they offer above minimum wage and have an awesome training team and program (even with all my internet problems starting out) the only reason i no

employer amazon has a great international presence and as such employs a vast variety of people. as a result, one meets and interacts with people from myriad backgrounds and nationalities, one gets to travel and experience this multi-national flavour.the company has a very rigorous attitude towards software development. there is a well-established discipline of testing and deployment. amazonians are very particular about how every feature/upgrade effects the customer, whether internal or external.as a hard core technology company, it uses state-of-the-art technologies and provides various opportunities in various aspects of software engineering. the company also provides internal training if one wishes to learn some new technology. friendly people, fun place to work. 1. good benefits2. flexible working hours3. good number of holidays i can't think of any. this company was probably the worst i have ever worked at. sickness and misery were everywhere. amazon gives everyone a chance. they're a cheap employer (codeword: frugal), and treat their people like cogs in the machinery (no, really - codeword: fungible) but at least they haven't developed an elitist culture. on the contrary, they do promote from within - if you play by the rules you can really work your way up like in few other places, and that's great, but if you take that route you'll be paid less than your peers coming from the outside or if you climb the ladder too high, you'll be under enormous pressure to deliver and/or at a constant risk of downgrade during next performance review.amazon is a place where scale happens and the law of large numbers applies; it's a big plus if you're into that sort of thing.there are good chances you'll find sharp people on your team, but if they're really good, they won't stay too long! good salary, good exposure to various technologies great work culture,flexible timings,horizontal movement have been working for more than 3 years now. good personal and work

true for any other pm openings in india. all the benefit. nice stock options. offices in downtown. great benefits, nice stock shares i got hired like a contract and the team is wonderful. you need to responsible for yourself towards work , no one has time to train you but you get lot resources to understand your goal and when needed your manager as well as your co-workers are always ready to respond you. the employees has lot of patience and when you ask a question repeatedly they will answer you without frustration. before my internship, i didn't have a very high expectation. a lot of people said on internet that amazon doesn't care much about its employee. but after my intership, i think amazon is amazing. everyone is super helpful here and i learned a lot from them. the work time is flexible and we can even work from home one day a week. amazon organizes many activities for interns, such as movies or picnics. also, seattle is a great city (in summer) with lots of fun places to visit. i enjoyed getting the overtime. several lunchrooms throughout the building as well as restrooms. if you are very quick and accurate you could get some awesome prizes! it is great if you like a

opportunities to advance in the company, competitive salary...etc. the culture is peculiar, have set leadership principles that can be understood and embraced by anybody in any department at any position. the cultural fit is looked into during interview process, employees breathe the principles everyday in everything they do, employees are reviewed semi-annually based on the leadership principles and these principles are time and again discussed, brainstormed and reviewed. \"feedback\" is another strong aspect that is received and taken constantly and people are very honest and share/give in a very respectful manner. extremely customer obsessed and opinions are always heard, considered and respected. the company is for people who want to taste excellence. very inspiring, innovative, data driven, empowers its employees to do great stuff.additional: good perks, compensation, stock options, good career growth i have heard from many people that the culture here at aws is reminiscent of my former employer from 2010 (ie. 5 years ago). work-life balance is great. expectations are reasonable. pay is above industry average for experience and position. i don't feel overworked or stressed. this comes down to the way we set expectations with our customers.i used to get phone call after phone call (about 10 per day on higher volume days) at my last employer and there was a large emphasis on us answering the phones because there was no automation system (it was part of their support ideals that you don't get menus or automated responses). here, we can tidy up the last project we were working on before taking on a new case, which lowers stress levels and lets us focus on the customer's case to the best of our ability so that we have less going on in our minds.meetings are not excessive and are very pointed (the floor meeting is once per week for about 30 minutes and has a clear agenda with relevant information for the engineers).team events/outings and general cohesiveness is abundant. knowledge sharing is fantastic. i feel like i'm truly making a difference when i walk in the door. oh yeah, flexible work environment: if i want to work from home, i can. if i want to work in the office, i can. if i want to fly home to visit family (or go to a reunion), i can do so and not take time off when i work remotely. * get to work with pretty

there are so many dogs. dogs all over the place. the compensation is pretty good, though for us yellow-badges it's not quite enough to live alone in seattle on. however, amazon promotes from within. find a starting job to get your feet in the door here and then after about 5-6 months, start looking to move up into the blue-badge jobs, which are amazon employees directly. working for the vendors

people who work here are all very smart and good at what they do. a fair amount of freedom (flexible hours, working from home when needed, dogs in the office, etc). enjoyed my contract at amazon but

keeps you motivated i've been with amazon alexa team for about 3 months now and am having a very positive experience!work: engaging with lots of learning and so much potential now and in the future.

employees and staff all-around lots of overtime available weekly, great resume builder, good health care innovative company with great opportunities to advance amazon is a challenging and opportunistic company. i have been given the freedom to propose new ideas and implement network wide changes. amazon has helped develop me through working in different fc's and departments in my career. ownership and their leadership principles fast-paced culture where you have the opportunity to experiment and launch new ideas and innovations without bureaucracy. generally ideas grow organically vs. are dictated from the top down which is a great opportunity for those who want to experiment with new products and features, test them, iterate and scale. success is dependent on your ability to iterate and scale products vs. nailing it on the first launch. if you are fortunate to work for a high quality manager, you'll learn from the best in the business. the environment is extremely intense and suited for those who can withstand a high pressure environment, intense scrutiny, and long hours. it is a great place for a new hire mba to learn and grow, or more senior level executives (director and above) to reap the benefits from the stock based compensation plan. the experience can be different for all people. some of the good things about working here of course are the pay and the people you have a chance to meet. working in customer service has many areas for specialization; retail, prime now, amazon logistics, to name a few. there are multiple helpful resources to find answers to problems. there are always new projects developing. frequent overtime opportunities. individuals can make exceptions to policies when it's in the customers best interest. fast paced and rewarding. people were focused on results and our team was driven to deliver on those results. great teamwork. great if you have no brains and like following rules.great for software developers. met a lot of nice people; casual environment - don't have to wear suit and high heel shoes. health care in the facility. if you're looking for a job that requires minimal thinking with a salary that will just get you by for a few months, this is the place for you. the pay is decent for a company that will hire just about anyone. the starting rate at my warehouse (robbinsville, nj) is $12.75 with a 50 cent raise for working at this specific location and another 50 cents for choosing the night shift. there is some opportunity for overtime pay as well, especially during amazon's peak season which occurs between nov-dec.the benefits are very good. they offer medical, vision, dental, 401k, educational assistance, and 4 shares of stock that must accrue for 2 years before they can be sold. they also offer medical leave and an extensive paid leave for parents expecting childbirth.the only other pro to this company is how they offer time off to their employees, but eventually this system fails for many employees after a few months. when you first become employed you are responsible for managing 3 types of time-off you are allowed to use: unpaid time off, paid time off, and vacation time. while they start you off with an abundance of hours at your disposal, improper use of this time will quickly come back to haunt you if you're not careful. also, if you go below 0 hours of unpaid time, you will be terminated, no matter what excuse you have for not being at work. most employees staying at amazon for more than 3-4 months will find themselves with little to no time left to take off from work if they do not stockpile them. there are no pros to working for amazon, besides good insurance. dogs in the office; tom douglas restaurants on campus; buildings have gorgeous views great place to learn about how to develop software, and how to support it. learn what it means to be customer focused. just work 8 hours a day you get to work with some very smart minds and experience the cutting edge in distribution. the pay is good, and good benefits. fun working with books and dvd's. i liked working the three 12 hours shifts over the weekend. so many opportunities to do any number of different jobs. you will work hard but be very well taken care of. amazon is a force for human progress. good place to start career but not good to stay its a job in this down market great technology skills to learn, very open to share the knowledge the career opportunities here are boundless. you have to look after yourself here because no one else will with amazon for 8+ years. it is an exciting place to work with so many things happening around the company. if you like to do a variety of things then amazon is a good place to work. good option for your resumé and a big opportunity to learn how a leader is expected to be (think big). permanent full time job with benefits. i love using leadership skills in my daily life too for my personal growth worst work life balance ever innovative company, smart people, and the culture of curiosity they hire you immediately when you apply online, drug test is oral so unless you're lighting up in the parking lot, everyone passes, and the pay and benefits are not so bad. great insurance and good people overall. if you do your job all is good. the work is easy but needs your motivation to meet the expectation. you can set your own schedule and can work up to 30 hrs per week. awesome work placeamazing peopleculture is excellent - opportunity to think big and implement game changing ideas- management takes out significant amount of time to listen to new ideas and good ones get prioritized- encouragement to try out new things, failure of pilots is not seen negatively liberal and highly effective work culture. excellent opportunities for internal job transfer/rotation 1. work from any where2. encourages your ideas3. we can learn very deeply about the process4. salary, cab allowances, sodexo coupons excellent employee benefits, you can apply for internal job transfers there is always something new, challenging, that would keep you engaged very competitve, all round development, > nice company values> no hierarchy within team> easy to talk/connect/learn from team mates> not hindered by too many processes at work> easy to change roles/teams high degree of ownershipfast-paced environmenthigh degree of innovationbiased to implement ideas without hierarchical blockersfair payment work environment is awesome.you can grow internally if u are equally talented and can take ownership for work.outing and events conducted throughout the year is awesome. high accountability for all. you get recoganisation for your work. data driven, lots of development, chance to innovation, smart people, high hiring bar, rewards the achievers, cool technology, freedom to write code, management buys into logical arguments, good compensation, very little politics, no glass ceiling, frugal, ability to switch teams easily (still requires interviews), intense customer focus, and passionate people.sdes are the bread and butter of this company, nothing moves unless sdes make it happen. management structure is thin, but hit or miss, but when they hit, its usually a homerun and you wonder why they decided to work at amazon and aren't running their own startup. sde are given very direct access to upper management, directors, vp and sometimes the senior vp. management structure is flat, makes it easy for superstars to stand out. good work is recognized and rewarded. average and below average engineers see little monetary increases in salary; very much a meritocracy. location, location, location - easy commute if you live in seattle.some smart folks working down in the \"trenches\".an \"ok\" job for someone right out of school, and never experienced anything better. but a <b>horrible experience</b> for a seasoned professional. smart colleaguesinteresting projectsgood learning opportunities there are a lot of smart people who are passionate about their jobs. if you are not afraid to express how passionate you are, then this is a potentially good environment to work for you. i say potentially because if you disagree the right way, people will listen. decisions are made with data support and tradeoffs are made when it benefits customers. if you understand you get the next job by doing it first, then it is the right place for you. i thought the base salary was pretty good. for someone willing to push for what they want, amazon is very open to people taking ownership, transferring to a group they're interested in, advancement, etc. if you're not happy with your current position, you can soon transfer to another group. i'd say that's the largest benefit, having the ability to basically choose your own career path and drive it at your own pace. amazon is the kind of company you'd go to, when you want to earn your programming chops. i know so many awesome developers who started out at amazon before they moved on to bigger better things. you'd think that a company with a core value of frugality wouldn't have some of the best salaries and benefits of all the big tech companies, but you'd be wrong. good people. good benefits. some projects are fun challenging work - which means you learn a lot.somewhat of an open door policy, where you can talk to senior management.high level of responsibility but equally rewarding financially and professionally.lots of smart people. worlwilde company with the commun interest

career progression fixed work pattern good overtime pay guaranteed hours high level of ownershipability to transfer teams pay and overtime ability with opportunity for advancement good pay, good benefits, great group of coworkers on the back half nights shift. good leadership at the tier 3 level. current manager is awesome. amnesty is fun. once you get your process down you pretty much work on your own. once you figure everything out it's relatively easy, but occasionally challenging depending on the day and what process your in. alot of the people you see complaining are the ones who couldn't cut it. at first it's not easy but you eventually perfect your process. honestly i make 200 -300% rate some days by accident. my record is 487%. but i'm not typical. also i had a seasoned veteran take me under his wing, and now another veteran from icqa is doing the same with the hopes i'll transfer. see the rate everyone is complaining about is actually revised every 3 months. they take the last 3 months work-flow and avarage it. somewhere in the middle is where they set the rate. except peak, because everything goes into overdrive. i actually spend much if my shift remembering to slow down because i realized i was raising the rates for every one else. some people have problems making rate, this job isn't for everyone. but most people actually have trouble with the quality aspect. you are only able to make about 1 or 2 mistakes a week or you get written up. 30 day, 60 day, 90, day. 4th written is termination. i got 3 in my first 5 weeks. i was basically fired. but the veteran helped me out and i survived the 90 day \"gauntlet\" (you can't make more than 1 mistake a week or your done). it's very rare someone survived the 90 days. in recent memory i'm the only one to

was concern reading about the work life balance before i joined nearly 5 years ago, but i have never had that issue. especially in sales. great group of people. also, the pay is fantastic. work with brand new technology, surrounded by brilliant minds who are often eager to share their knowledge. amazon is a place where anyone with a good idea can go out and implement it. the majority of employees seem to be focused on finding innovative solutions, instead of roadblocking change. amazon takes care of their employees. they make working there fun and i really enjoy the people that i work with. amazon is known to hire the best, and it really shows in the hard work and dedication most employees have. 1. loads of learning opportunities.2. if you are not happy with your current team, if you are

resigned. i started directly out of college as an area manager and promoted once a year to operation manager, and was starting to get tapped for senior operations manager. the progression at this

little division of labor. ui, schema design, implementation, testing, maintenance... high hiring standards have paid off - your peers are very competent and many downright inspiring. the company really does make long-term strategic commitments and stick to them. employees truly do frame meetings around \"so how is this good for the customer?\" the entreprenuerial culture makes amazon a great place to grow your career if you're the kind of person who will not only pick up the ball and run with it, but will make the ball in the first place. if you're looking for someone to lead you by the

the peers are high quality and the opportunity for self improvement is high. smart people, lots of exciting job opportunities, growing business, gain a lot of experience in a short period of time very aggressive and ownership oriendted while the amazon mentality is con for others, it's a huge pro for me. my job is loosely defined and i received no formal training upon arrival. i love that. i had to be self-directed, find my own resources and create a niche in my team. my job can be what i make of it. i define my goals, propose projects, suggest changes to existing projects and choose to meet or exceed expectations. helicopter bosses are not encouraged but i, as an individual contributor, have to do my part to prove that i can work autonomously. on a daily basis i have to find the data to prove my points before blindly making assumptions, write narratives to support my projects and define (and redefine) my goals. speaking up with constructive solutions is consistently encouraged. the famous \"?\" email from bezos, while intimidating, reminds us that everything is open for questioning and smart inquisition is encouraged. amazon is the only company i've worked for that loudly and proudly displays its leadership competencies. in fact, almost everything i do can roll up into a particular leadership competency. usually our actions are justified and rewarded in accordance with these core values. finally, i love that we're encouraged to change positions every 18-24 months (lateral move or otherwise) so no one gets stuck in a single-minded rut. i had the fortune of being asked to move to a better role after just 6 months (a rare exception). fast growth, lots of opportunities, competitive compensation good pay, people are hungry for innovation and solid opportunities

qualified peers and seniors, very good pay, good work culture ,flexible timing good programgood peopleopportunity to grow personally very smart people work here. good work excellent learning experience nice enviornmet if you read previous reviews you will see several common themes:1) interns or junior people with no or limited experience usually write about quick learning. yes, you learn quickly at amazon, as the amount of work that a regular employee usually gets is 2-4x more than at other more employee-friendly companies. in other words, your learning process is a multiple of workload and time spent at work.in addition, you will have to catch things quicker because you will own your area of responsibilities, which is a good thing… if your previous experience and skillset qualify you to own that. otherwise, it is usually trial and error learning, while amazon does not tolerate any errors. in other words, you will learn something, but as soon as you make a mistake you will become history through the performance improvement process (pip) process.the question is why you would not learn at another company at a slower pace with manageable workload and at least some training support instead of self-learning through internal wikipedia and waiting in long lines to business intelligence office hours or something similar?2) some people write about “good benefits”… if amazon is the only employer in small town, it is probably true. however, in terms of base compensation it is usually below average. the stock part of the compensation is deceptive, given that the average employee retention period is now less than a year and you will need to work several years to fully vest that amount. even if you literally survive at amazon all those years, the amount of stock is still below the cumulative amount of annual bonuses that you can earn at other companies that require to work 60-100 hours per week (e.g. investment banking and management consulting). there are no other perks, because of the frugality principal.3) some people also say hat it is good to have amazon brand on their resume. many people who have never heard stories of their friends and relatives working at amazon believe that the company is as good to its employees as it is to its customers. customer obsession is what drives recognition and appreciation of amazon’s brand. however, whenever i speak with random people in seattle, all of them tell me the same thing: “amazon is the least popular employer in the area. it is famous for making its employees overwork and for its high turnover”. if you get an offer or you are in seattle area for your interviews, go to a local grocery store or a coffee place and ask people there what they think about amazon. i wish i did the same due diligence when i came to seattle for my interviews.4) innovative projects are something that some people also mentioned in previous reviews. amazon is a laggard that usually does reverse engineering of consumer products that other more innovative companies pioneer. the “innovation” part is how to make those products cheaper by using cheaper materials or reducing functionality.5) all those smart, type a personality people at amazon is definitely a “bundle of joy”, in particular, when it comes of scarce promotion openings. the value proposition of working with smart people is not to compete with them, but to learn from them. you will unlikely have a chance to have a mentor or have decent team work to learn from your peers as amazon culture is very individualistic, mainly, due to the ownership principle. starting pay is 10.5 regardless of warehouse experience. there is the possibility for overtime especially during the holidays. depending on your job it is good exercise. you get the opportunity to meet a lot of different and interesting people. if you can survive the 'black out' period (seasonal holidays) there is a high possibility of converting to a full time amazon employee. once new year's is over you automatically get ato (approved time off) through the temp agency iss (integrity staffing solutions). ato allows you to miss work or be late without it counting against you. very smart and generally passionate people. interesting problems. brilliant and inspiring leaders at the very top. starting salary, team, culture, peers an incredible place to work;friendly people at all levels;a true learning experience;they hire seniors;an excellent exercising work environment compensation is extremely lucrative. i get to work with robots! how cool is that :) the people i interact with on a daily basis are amazing; they're family. the work atmosphere is upbeat, energetic, positive, driven and definitely innovative! i look forward to each and every day at amazon. life here is good, very good! salary is good pay for the work amazon has provided me with a wonderful opportunity to grow and develop. i have never been apart of a team that truly promoted each others growth as much as i have here. ideas are taken seriously, ambitions are heard, and goals are in reach. incredible solution set. wonderfully customer centric approach. built into every we do in the account management team. super flexible, great for moms working with exceptionally bright people who get things done. benefits and good career opportunities full time job and benefits paid weekly, no one standing over your head, breaks whenever. the main pro about the reserve customer service associates is the flexibility and the ability to make your own schedule as well as to work from your home. excellent benefits such as career choice program the pay is decent and it comes with benefits. -competitive pay for the area and industry-time off structure is well thought out and very fair-amazing benefit package: healthcare and dental/vision are cheap but very, very good-guaranteed 40 hours but plentiful voluntary time off opportunities for those who want to work less

night shift diferencial pay. provides great opportunity to learn how a big company works working with smart, hard-working people who's top objective is satisfying our customer. the rapid growth provides opportunities to increase scope and/or rotate to larger roles. it's a great place to work.. i love the different people you'll meet. it's fast paced and you get to train in different department. i love how it gave me benefits from day on, some that's very important to me. good hours, over time almost available, nice and courteous managers and supervisors as well as leads. management treats you fairly. your hard word is recognized and appreciated. amazing data sets, cool tools, dynamic team, great compensation work in a fast paced environment. many smart people you can learn from. interesting projects. full 40 hours, pay, tuition reimbursement, overtime, days off, hired basically anyone, easy interview, anybody can do the job, simple to learn you get to experience something completely different than most jobs. its a good company to grow with good benefits, decent pay , and light work. lots of smart people. good pay, able to work on big projects. great workplace for great workers leadership principals are good guidelines for life (imo) on top of work. lots of opportunity for those who work hard and have good self-awareness. the ability to prioritize and know when to say no are useful to your career success. interesting company where no day is the same. it's decent pay. $12.50 an hour is pretty decent. you don't really have to worry about your hours changing on you. break room offers alot of food and drinks. good benefits and smart people around fast paced environment, where things are constantly changing. if you liked being outside of your comfort zone and learning new skill sets on a daily basis than this is the place for you. i have had multiple days when leaving work where i can honestly tell that i have gotten smarter because of how many great people are thinking big! there is so much growth opportunity, that it makes 10/hr worth it. i have been given opportunities to move around within amazon and i have only been with them going on 6 months. - a growing team - as amazon adds new web services they add new writers. they don't just throw the new work on our existing writers' plates.- a strong editorial support staff - a really

tooling to allow us to focus on what really matters: describing complex technology for our customers.- flexibility - we can work from home one or more days each week as long as we get the job done. we

quite as it is. good salaries, good opportunities and never a dull moment. what i liked was that in general, it is a very forward thinking company and open to all ideas to ensure processes are managed and profitability is improved. - great develop during the first months good work culture, healthy environment only environment and facilities like cab etc are good others are total waste -competitive salary- if you are incredibly driven you can force exposure to very senior leadership- great potential role for people that enjoy sales- opportunity to be exposed to some extremely talented people

amazing flexible hours if you work a full-time and looking for a part-time but must work one day out of the weekend! the starting pay is decent and you'll have plenty of overtime. it's a paycheck every week. pay and benefits are top class. learned a lot about the industry. great benefits, many different teams to cater to everyone's interests the scale that amazon's systems run at is ridiculous, meaning that even the most boring projects result in interesting technical challenges. you will also have a great degree of freedom in the technologies and tools that you use to solve problems. only pros were money, hours, co workers decent pay.decent work/life balance if you do your job smart and lucky to be in a good team.retail business lead. very gud, nice company, nice people

package, great industry leading experience and rapid growth. all of these things make your resume stand out as well as having the opportunity to transfer to a different department or city due to the rapid growth of the company. the pay is pretty decent. they treat their employees well and give plenty of vacation time/sick days. there is room for advancement as well. good pay, benefits, 3 days off when not on mandatory overtime. fast growth means that promotions are common and expected. it's a good place to gain a lot of experience, fast, and get rewarded for it. i am lucky to have a great set of managers, who minimize the (inevitable) bureaucracy and look for our best interests. the workload is very manageable; my team works 40--44 hours a week.the company is in a dense area of seattle, so it's very convenient to reach work by mass transit. bias for action, you'll never be bored if you're doing things right, easy to move within the company to other roles after one year. the culture is great, people are smart. the customer really is first all the time. provides great benefits, fair wage, and facilitates a work-life balance. it was very laid back and the work was challenging and interesting. sometimes you had to spend the few extra hours on work, but where do you not? has a great culture with lots of opportunities for team outings. i was thoroughly surprised at the amount of room there is to grow in aspects of software and hardware development. you own you're projects and are held at a high standard. benefits, bonuses, and time off are great! wages are mediocre, but the bonuses and overtime go a long way. i get a lot of satisfaction from being able to develop creative projects and try them out in production. the pay is good and benefits are also competitive. you get to say you worked at amazon.com move anywhere in the country always 40 hrs plus plenty of overtime the best benefit of working at amazon is the amazing array of coworkers. you meet everyone from mit graduates to post-military special ops (and all folks in-between). most of the people at amazon are no bs types who don't like office politics. those are the people i love working with the most. amazon's technical environment offers experience and learning opportunities you cannot get anywhere else. server management, ruby/perl programming, cisco, linux, network cabling, project management, etc - all in one job. the company culture is based on objectivity, responsibility, and precision. this means there is little to no \"politics\" or egos to stroke. great for people who like to work fast and hard and not waste time. no classism or age-ism like you sometimes see in young hot tech companies. you have a chance to work with cool and smart people in technology side but not in design side. it is totally up to your boss if the job is fun or not. nice environment but insensitive people opportunities abound. innovative new work being done all day every day. rapid growth company. environment that encourages creativity. autonomy is granted if you know your stuff. dogs allowed in the office. casual dress environment. learned more about business and process efficiency in 4 years at amazon than i did in 10 years in my prior jobs. you get to learn a lot and get very good experience seattle campus hires amazing, accomplished designers to work on device platform. the hiring process is thorough but appropriate and the talent level is great. getting paid to work on some interesting projects (in between some really crappy ones). there are some start-up-like groups within the company that launched interesting experiments. the money is the only good thing the people you work with become like family new technology. you will be trained to work under stress. i was in seattle, it was a very good experience for interns here. i was in a department has very good work life balance. my teammates most of the time works 8 hours everyday and we had a lot of recreational activities after work. i went to watch a base ball with my mentor played some board game at my managers house etc, etc. there might be someone saying that amazon is a terrible company to work at, i will not deny that some team has terrible work-life balance, but at least the team i worked at is not one of that kind. its leadership principles create well rounded individuals and keep the focus on the right things treated me like family. everyone took great pride in their work best tech engineers and tech problemsspeed of business is amazing and fast, lots to learn the work days were really long, and i learned how to pick and pack. the managers were good, they always found ways to keep us up beat and going. most of the co workers were nice and very helpful if you had questions about the jobs. the hardest part of the job was the long shifts, and kind of short breaks for the ten hour days. i really enjoyed the fast pace work. great locationbig company name recognitionwas proud to work for them plenty of opportunities for entry to mid level employees to pitch big ideas and make difference. great compensation for people who can make it past 2 years. competitive pay, great benefits,
